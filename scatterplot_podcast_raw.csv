185699549,"""A Tale of Two Cities"" Audiobook (Audio book)",Books,Charles Dickens performed by Jane Aker,185699549,31,58285,excellent very well done all i could want highly recommended pure perfection audiobook rating masterful rendition of a masterpiece love it perfect multitasking good reading must listen to this classic thank you loved it the best way to experience this book a tale of 2 cities the tale of two cities brought back good memories very helpful so helpful alright re laxbro2    best help ever if you dont like to read awesome this was great  perfect  this is great so much help thanks this is awesome free is what like to hear free is good  invaluable wow well spoken but hard to follow this is fantastic thank you very enjoyable  this is sooooo good jane aker saved my english grade wow love it wonderful a tale of two cities fabulous apparently its a classic for a reason must listen thank you fabulous great rendition thanks wow i love this soooo much fantastic story there is a god great but not working great so easy to understand better loudlit org is awesome  excellent reading  highly recommend  narrator is very good  it is a tad slow but i wont take any stars off for that because you can just listen at double speed  thats how i listened and it was great  my favorite novel read so well i cannot distinguish between memories of my own reading experience and the audio experience   its a wonderful tale of two formats  excellent book a well done audiobook  amazing but i love the woman who narrates it  this is a life saver for students who are crunched on time because it keeps you at a good pace  i have read tale of two cities a couple of times  i consider it to be a timeless tale i can easily relate to  dickens use of imagery phrasing to convey the emotion and atmosphere of the settings in his novel is the work of a master weaver of epic scope  ms  akers reading does great justice to this masterpiece which in itself is no small accomplishment  amazing audiobook  i love the story it was my first time hearingreading it i love the reader she has a great voice she does different voices for different speakers and she doesnt talk too fast or too slow i love dickenss writing techniques and imagery and love that this audio book is free so nice to listen something without an intro and ads every episode  great narration i really dislike being read to and always have but this is a necessity on busy nights  i have to read this book for my english class and being able to hear the voices change and make distinction between characters while i work on other homework every night is extremely helpful to my understanding of the text  it makes long nights seem notaslong  having to speed up the audio is a bit annoying though because it doesnt seem as natural but normal speed is much too slow for my liking  otherwise it is a great tool thats all  the librivox version 2 is also good this audiobook brought the book to life  the madam who lends her voice is wonderful and she does a fabulous job the entire time i usually do not write reviews but i had to write this one as a thank you to the people who produced this excellent podcast  jane a  is a fantastic narrator  i enjoyed every moment  ive had frustrating experiences with audiobook podcasts in the past and was a little apprehensive about this one at first  but janes reading is steady clear striking a perfect balance between drama and restraint  i really enjoyed this book and i know its all because of jane and her passionately constrained interpretation  thank you so much for offering such a highquality audiobook for free thank you to jane a  an impressive narrator   it would have been very easy to over dramatize the narration and accents  and entirely botch the depth of the authors intent  the narrator read each passage so beautifully and yet in such an understated manner that i was compelled to stop the recording to reread and reconsider particular passages  of exceptional beauty    in summary  the narration enhanced the prose and brought what could have been a very cumbersome text to life  i have a new appreciation of dickens and the depth of his humanity   i had previously thought of him as merely a serial writer of lugubrious christmas tales    thank you librivox for a literary and auditory experience i will always cherish  i not very good with old english but the audio book helped me understand  thank you for creating this loved reading it many years ago loved to listen to it  i have a hard time focusing on books with old english but we have to read this for my honors english class  this made it alot easier for me to understand and concentrate  thanks for creating this  i literally cannot focus when im reading by myself so to have this ebook is simply amazing got the highest quiz grade personally of the year after using it really great tool thank you glad to see a free audiobook but i wish it was formatted as one rather than as a podcast  speaker is dry and slow using the double speed function on my iphone is a must  book is long drawnout and unnecessarily wordy but that is no fault of this work  fell asleep while listening first time i heard this  this is not stupid summer reading it is in fact widely considered one of the most important pieces of literature ever written  but what more can you expect from a lax bro i had to read this book for my summer project for school and i hate to read  so it help a lot to listen to the book i am going to be a freshmen this upcoming year and we have to read this book  it is probably the most boring book i have read but i had to get through it    a friend showed me these an immediately i was hooked  i will be glad to recommend this to all of my friends to help them get through stupid summer reading to  i loved jane aker she really livened this otherwise slow book that im required to read and made me appreciate the true greatness of the book  she really helped me follow the book thoroughlythanks  helps me concentrate so much this is soo helpful  i need to read this for school and listening to it on my ipod while i read along reeeeeally helped me  this is a tough book dickens is tough this is really great  i highly recommend to anyone like me who cant focus when reading a hard book  the book itself is very hard to read but is so much easier to listen to thank you d using this audio book set at x2 on my ipad im making great time on this book much better than if i were reading it silently  i can finish these difficult chapters in 15 minutes per chapter tops  plus its free  so helpful thanks again this is great  would recomend to anyone who has to read this for an english class  loved it free   this is what i like in life  ive also downloaded other books as well for example great expectations and best of all its free helping all those in need of finishing a book not all too peachy on the idea of actually reading the words and the penny pinchers of society  this podcast was perfect for helping me keep up with the reading in my college english lit class  i love how they include the text so that you can read along if you like  only small issue is that some of the text is cut off at the end  even with this little flaw highly recommend powerful story  masterfully narrated  thoroughly enjoyed every word  highly recommended  i have not read the book but thought it would be interesting to listen to  i had a hard time following along and staying interested in the story  i got about halfway through the entire thing and decided to move on and find something else to listen to  i do like how they performed it though the story was just not for me  i have to read this next year for school and it really helps that this book is free also i really like the fact that the reader conveys emotions well and the plot is more exciting than if i had just read it myself  i will have to read it in print anyway but this helps me understand the book much better  thanks itunes for allowing this to be free thanks so much for making this free i definitely didnt want to have to pay like 18 bucks for this kind of thing but i really needed the podcast to keep myself focused while reading it for school  this really made my life easier i thoroughly enjoyed jane akers spirited reading of this classic  her obvious love of a good story carried me all the way to the memorable last words  just download it listen to it get over the flowery arcane language and simply enjoy some of the best works of man   simple as that  the words and story are unforgettable  the interpretation is excellent and the finest literature in the world is yours  history repeats itself daily  believe it wow this podcast saved my life  i  had to read this book for my english class  but couldnt stay  focused and when i could stay focused i had no idea what i was reading  so thank you jane aker im so glad they have this it helps find thing you would have never noticed thank you for the podcasts  made my confusion in the plot of the story more understanding a great tool to use for those who are more of a auditorial learner  well done   thoroughly entertaining jane aker does a marvelous job    looking forward to additional programs  a tale of two cities was fabulous  i was hooked   i really liked the fact that it played at least two chapters an episode   using the different voices was also very helpful  i was apprehensive about listening to such a boring story but jane aker really brings it alive   i listen to many podcasts and many of those are literature related and her presentation in clear well produced and informed  if you are interested in reading great literature but need a boost in getting started or if you enjoy audiobooks  i highly recommend this podcast  this is one of the all time best novels and the narrarator did a wonderful job of conveying the emotions and attitudes of the characters   her voice was so lively and entertaining you almost feel like you are there talking with the characters i am a freshman going into the international baccalaureate program and this is one of the books we have to read  im usually a good reader i enjoy books and all but this book was being a bit stubborn and harder to read than anything else  i bought the cliffs notes for it but figured in the end it would be easier just to listen to it  i expected to have to buy it but in this case i could just download it i completely enjoyed this and i made it through the book i highly recommend it ms aker is clearly very talented and brings this story to life superbly read by ms  aker  this makes a long train ride home everyday relaxing and entertaining  this really helped me out with my book report it is a very slow reader but that helps you to understand it  thanks so much thank you so much this audiobook is so greatall i can say is thanks 3 the reading is done so well as to bring the story to life  oh thank you thank you thank you sooooo much for putting this on here i dont understand the book very much and its so much clearer on the audio book  and thanks for putting it as a podcast im so happy its free i am so happy that these are here  thank you so much the only problem is i cant get some episodes like   6 8  11   if anyone could help it would be so helpful because i really want these podcasts   once again thank you for putting it on thank you  enjoy this so much its so confusing to just read the book by itself  when listening to the audiobook its easier to understand what its trying to say to us  these recordings are great   i like the fact that they embed the text in the recording so you can read along if you want   the huck finn podcast is great too   great work  i hope they keep bringing public domain stuff to podcasts   makes long trips super enjoyable and its a lot cheaper and of at least equal quality to the more expensive audiobooks   yea public domain and loudlit org

not have known how to feed my family because we werent going to stores or seeing our extended family  i also would have been so frightened thinking my obgyn may not have my best interests at heart

baby  we had a hard time breastfeeding all the lactation clinics were closed and the only way we got help was because i had found because the podcast suggested doing a preconsult the one lactation

a fresh perspective  great interviews by a great interviewer love this podcast great podcast you had me at uncle tupelo its like being there  12 piece with hot mustard great interviews and live music segments most excellent podcast just discovered this  awesome an honest podcast an easy listen  great interviewing super interesting this is more than just a podcast great stuff what a treat thanks  well done hands down one of the best awesome podcast favorite listening to episode 182 and you are 100 correct  trying to bully someone someone because they dont have the same agenda as you is not ok regardless of your age gender sex race or sexual orientation   you did nothing wrong did not do what you were accused of and good for you for not apologizing for something you didnt do best interview with brian setzer everthanks in my weekly rotation i subscribed to this podcast because i like to hear your interviews with interesting musicians    i specifically dont listen  for your political opinion   can you control your tds  doubt it  bye  host talks too much about himself   great guests   keep it about them  well done sir  enjoyed many hours of interview of some great musical legends  thanks for bringing intimate conversations to life  got turned on to this when walking the floor interviewed tood snider   great appreciation for music history and the songwriter experience   still working my way through the back catalog  i am a 11 year old girl who loves social distortion  me and my dad had a bad relationship not gonna get into details then me and him were riding down a highway in california and he played his old social d albums and i  it  then we went to concerts and he told me storys  so thats what i love their music and the power in music keep it up hard to listen to the political rants  this is a great podcast for a music lover  im a pretty heavy podcast listener  chris is one of the best most genuine hosts out there  i also really like the guests on the show  ive heardofknewof many but theres just as many i hadnt heard of  ive explored their music on spotify after the shows and have come up with some new favorites  as a country music nerd historian i was a bit skeptical of this podcast  however i have come to love it  especially after working through most of the older interviews  chriss conversational style seems to bring people out  sometimes questions asked make me feel old but they dont seem to offend his subjects  i especially loved the merle haggard interview  my only complaint is his seeming obsession with gear tho he even points out in the patterson hood chat that that seems to be a generational interest  just not mine  i love the ending acoustic songs most people do  overall a fascinating well done podcast i thought this would have been a good listen  however the very first episode i listened to he opened the show up with how much he likes communism and socialism and preached that we need to welcome that into america  not what i was expecting and nothing i want to listen to  i did not click on his show thinking it was a political show  nor did i know he was a communist  i am so sad to hear those words come out of his mouth  i would have expected him to be happy hes an american living off the capitalist society that made him millions  hes famous because people bought his bands stuff  not because of communism or socialism and doesnt he realize that the state of california is already a socialist state and its failing pretty hard  chris i thought you were smarter than that  i wish you the best kid  thanks for helping keep the bakersfield sound alive  based on all the bakersfield musicians you introduced me to in your podcast i discovered that merleand buck were just the tip of the bakersfield music iceberg   i bought the bear family bakersfield box set and love it  great opening notes chris on a very important musical collection  now i just need to get me a left handed telecaster thanks for a great show and keep em coming  love this podcast chris  my son turned me on to it and we both listen as we really enjoy the artists and the way chris manages the conversation trades anecdotes and provides just the right environment for the guests to enjoy themselves  if you love live music and want to feel closer to the artist on stage take a listen to this podcast  chris schifflett creates a dynamic peer to peer rapport with each individual he interviews and draws out information about the artist and their work that lets you feel more informed and closer to the source  all this and yet no pretense i love americana music and wait for every new interview to learn more  thanks chris great stuffand vinces hard laugh at the end was priceless amanda shires is the only female i see listed  im excited to listen to this series but turned off by yet another forum where female artists are not represented with any attempt for balance  on the justin moore podcast  before he starts talking to justin he talks about politics  why bring politics into a music based podcast so glad i found this pod after hearing chris on uncle joeys pod  so wonderfully insightful and interesting  would love to hear him interview robert earl keen cody canada james mcmurtry charlie robison chris is doing a great job with this podcast  his style is very natural and authentic  as a listener you feel like you are hearing the inside story with all his guests  my favorite podcast bar none great interviews that really give one insight to what its like writing songs recording and touring  i love the interviews   they give an inside look at what its like to be an musician on the road   give it a try and you wont be disappointed  this is a great podcast but i would love to hear him interview some of the great female artists out there  elizabeth cook lilly hiatt erin rae nikki lane margo price amanda shires so many great women who deserved to be heard  chris does an amazing job show after show  ive gained a knowledge and appreciation for music i never knew  thanks hands down the best podcast out there that interviews singers and guitar slingers  chris definitely has a career after the foo fighters just doing this  love this podcast but theres a voice in the intro song i cant quite put my finger on whos all singing in the intro thanks for the help keep up the good work chris yewwwww keep it up chris  im a rock guy but thanks for broadening my musical horizon   great to hear about folks like shakey graves blackberry smoke and garrett t capps  looking forward to new episodes where the hell have i been thank goodness for hayes carll and instagram  hayes posted about this podcast on his insta here recently  i left tulsa early this morning and now im in the middle of nowhere nw kansas and havent stopped listening  this is excellent listening 5 stars great podcast for those who know a ton about classic country music or for the person who wants to star learning about it  city kid and rock guy who also loves roots country  chris shiflett keeps the focus on his guests   love that   he gets the full story but doesnt dwell on the headline parts   love the biography stuff but also the gear and artistic process discussions   thanks chris chris rocks in everything he does shiflett does a great job  hes obviously a fan of great music and musicians  give it a listen  i discovered walking the floor a few years ago   i knew i had found a keeper when chris referenced and showed great appreciation for the band uncle tupelo   but im also a fan of chris 95 bands  i have enjoyed the diverse interviews with different music genres song writing and guitar gear   the facetime of jason isbell is a highlight   keep them coming chris and thank you  when listening to this podcast i feel like im there in the room with chris and his guests listening to candid conversations among musicians  even though i lack the genes to be a good musician music is part of me and im happy to find this venue that takes us the listeners beyond the glam and superficial to the hearts and minds of musicians  im also happy to learn about the gear that translates the sound in musicians minds to the outside world  i recommend this podcast to anyone who likes to explore music on a deeper level  this podcast is definitely a 12 piece with hot mustard  other shows are a 3 piece  chris has great respect for the country music genre and i love when he goes into gear related content  he gets high profile artists as well as great alt country artists  i love that often we get acoustic renditions at the end of interviews as well  chris you should play tunes sometime too chris love your show and guestwhat joy to learn about the music and artist we admire keep it upmore more morevery disappointed though today october 9 your comments regarding the justice cavanagh hearings in my opinion that woman was a liar framing and innocent man you should just stick to the music because i will listen to your show and i love it but i totally disagree with your political hack statements lets just work on the musicthanksallan this is such a cool show   thanks for doing it chris i was looking for a podcast that just talks music preferably old country and stumbled across this one  i knew about the bakersfield sound since  i live close to it but i never learned about it  chris covers it and a variety of music  he turned me on to me first and the gimme gimmes  try it out chris does an amazing job of making his guests feel comfortable and open up about their careers  its an easy listen and so much fun ive plowed through a good chunk of the episodes and keep coming back for more really interesting to hear the links between the artists country punk and the history of the guests   chris does a great job with the questions and interaction despite his guilt in dropping out of school to pursue his passion for music chris has proven to be an excellent studentstudying as much as possible about his guests and asking intelligent questions  this is not simply a podcast this is oral history i like the diversity of artists  definitely not mainstream pop music but musicians that make their living by traveling around the country playing clubs  and the fact that its hosted by someone that can also identify with their efforts make these conversations worth a listen  just found this podcast recently  what a treat  ive spent all day listening to older pods  he is  a great interviewer  knowing the business allows h8m to ask very pertinent questions  chris gets out of his own way to really talk to other artists    turned me on to cocaine and rhinestones podcast too just starting catching up on this podcast  chris does a great interview   would love to hear more interviews from those within the punk scene  stumbled across this podcast because i love all things foo fighters and want to support the guys in all of their side projects  holy cow i was blown away chris is a fantastic interviewer and i love the ease at which the conversations flow  one of my favorite episodes so far was with sheryl crow i seriously felt like i was right there listening to her speak  please keep up the great work and keep these podcasts coming  little love from lower alabama best podcast out there this is my absolute favorite music podcast  chris allows his guests to speak and always finds common ground with them  hes respectful of his guests time and story and is very humble  thanks chris for your fantastic show  nan,50,4.5

seen this coming it really is needed life changing the way to move forward change the world it truly is needed as a cop this is a relief  i absolutely love the work these guys do  although they are not the most famous people in the world they are people i look up to  they love their job and as someone who wants to get into law enforcement i hope to follow in their footsteps  they have set stepping stones for someone like me and ill forever be grateful for it  thank you ryan aj and billy  these guys are insightful and their ability to stay objective is refreshing  they speak from experience and do so in a humbling manner  theyre funny and easy to listen to  the fact of their faith is what really drew me in further  keep fighting the good fight guys and thank you for your services in your communities as officers and thank you for helping these guys out to keep this podcast going billy  prayers for continued growth in this podcast along with growth in your lives  be well this is one of my favorite podcasts to tune into  these guys have a refreshing perspective on law enforcement and current events  they approach things in an objective and common sense way and thats what we need more of today  this really is needed this is such a awesome glimpse of what law enforcement life is like im a family member of a leo and this helps me to understand and thank you for being so open thank you thank you thank you i absolutely love this podcast  as an officer i find that the wisdom given is spot on and just helping me become a better officer  please continue with the great content and truths you guys give  maybe one day you guys will add a female to the stuff lol now that would be awesome then all gender perspectives will be given  bring back the internet memes segment  last year i got the courage to walk away from my career as a corrections officer and start fresh  it was a scary thought as i had been doing the job now for over 10 years  i am now doing something completely different but i have a huge heart for law enforcement and the public service customers aka the community  i love the mission of bbu and the itsneeded podcast  my only complaint is i wish i had found you guys sooner i have now binge listened to all the podcasts and am caught up and relistening to them in reverse order while i work  i feel like your podcast is something i needed that has been missing in my life for a long time dont ever change who you are your faith is inspiring  thanks again guys  i am a high school student and aspiring police officer and your podcast is my favorite thing to listen to while im at work and doing other tasks  it gives me a great inside look into the field and great advice that i will not only carry on duty but also throughout other life situations  thank you guys for your service and keep up the good work  now disclaimer on this review ive been a listener now since the killing of george floyd  ryans take opened the doors to this wonderful podcast and reflected my personal feelings about that tragic event as a leo myself  im admittedly a bit biased towards this show because of my own experiences in the profession  this show pulls back the curtain on law enforcement and i believe its good for people to hear different perspectives  the conversation is innately polarizing in todays social and political climate but itsneeded does a wonderful job in its attempt to bridge the gap between policing and the community  for me personally ive worked very hard to model myself after the ideals and ethics of law enforcement but this show is a penchant reminder that empathy education and hard work is not a destination but a lifelong journey  a journey that recommit to everyday  on the community side ryan aj and billy all do their best to draw from their personal experiences to bring a dynamic to the show that makes it relatable  these are real people who were a part of the community before they were officers or a part of this show  additionally they bring in a wide variety of guests from faith leaders le leaders and community activists for a conversation that is unique and building  specifically the episodes with leon ford were very powerful and worth the time of revisiting  plus the guys are just great personalities for podcasts  its a good balance  lastly to anyone that reads this review if you subscribe to acab ideology i challenge you to give it a listen  i think many people who support blm believe that police and black lives are antithetical  that binary however really undermines the need that both sides have to work together to achieve the change we seek  some people and i know quite a few would shrug this off as a police apologist podcast or copaganda but the reality is the world is far more nuanced than many give it credit for and this conversation is no different  break through the echo chambers because itsneeded  thank you for what you are doing to bridge the gap between law enforcement and our communities   when we do our jobs correctly as police officers we are truly doing gods work   god bless you for representing us leos and having difficult conversations to solve issues and come up with solutions   be safe out there brother   god is in control   thanks ryan and aj hey guys i found yall on instagram tillmans take and i swear its the most real page ive ever followed when it comes to law enforcement rea issues and the community  i was ready to hang it up after 4 short long years  but after listening to the im not here to get you to like the police it made me realize again why i do what i do  its so incredibly difficult right now but i know that deep down my heart is where its supposed to be  my life has been shaped into my dream come true since i put my badge on  i love what you guys do and im going to tell all my guys and girls to listen i loved this episode i have been following aj on tiktok for awhile and love everything he does for his community  this was very informative podcast  this is perfect place to find unbiased facts and a better understanding of the current events we are so deeply effected by in todays society  these guys give great advice and are inspirational for law enforcement    but as a wife of a cop i find solace listening as well  i think i can say my worry for my husband and his profession is much higher than his own  or maybe thats just what he wants me to believe  i get ease of mind knowing that there are people out there who get it and support the men and women protecting and serving their communities  my biggest take away from their podcast is how important it is to try and be understanding of other people and their views even when they seem so incredibly misguided  we cant just cut people out of our lives because we have different opinions  i love how these guys accept everyone even those who bash them on a daily basis for what they do  that is inspirational in itself and has taught me that this world needs more people like that and im going to do my best each day to be one of them  we can all still be united though we have different opinions  even if you hate my husband and what he does i will still love you and try an educate you of the hero he is to myself and so many others  grateful for these guys and what they are doing  i hope more people listen and get as big of a takeaway from it that ive had  itsneeded these guys are truly having the conversations thats needed and speaking about the truth and how to make a difference in the world we need keep it up guys i made a hard choice to leave my law enforcement career after 10 years  i was jaded and cynical and as a believer i was not happy with where i was at mentally and spiritually  more to that but suffice it to say the itsneeded podcast is some of the best content for an aspiring current or former leo  and i appreciate the faith aspect and closing with a prayer keep up the amazing work you two   three counting billy im a military cop im 22 and have a few more years to go until i can be a civilian police officer but i love the dialogue on this podcast and how yall keep it real the first podcast of your alls i listened to was the one about breonna taylor  i thought it was great  it was real truthful and honest which is a complete 180 from most social media news programs and podcasts   thank you for thatkeep up the good fightbacktheblue ive known aj for a number of years and have always valued his opinion   im glad his and ryans voice is being heard because it brings a much needed perspective from a side that is traditionally silenced   i love the podcast and have been binge listening to catch up on missed episodes  every week i look forward to listening to this podcast  my husband in le and i usually listen in together  it helps me understand his challenging career especially with times like today  thank you for taking the time to do this god bless been sharing with fellow leos and friends that have no clue about le  the taylor episode is very much needed and detailed for all to understand information is mandatory before conclusions are made  thank you for all that you guys do i love this podcast  very unbiased  you would think a podcast with two police officers that this would be a very one sided point of view  but ryan and aj avery fair and objective about all subjects they speak about  i never miss an episode  this is a great podcast and good source of information when it comes to policing and societal issues in general  unfortunately many people are not willing to put in the work to find accurate information on topics they preach these days  i would suggest those people refer to this podcast as one of their sources of information  it is also refreshing to find a podcast that is not slamming on either political party but trying to inform and show people that balance is possible  bravo  thank you for not only breaking it down but breaking it down in a way that civilians who have no police experience can better understand i really enjoy your podcast  thank you so ive never been much into podcasts especially the longer ones but this one is really exceptional  these guys do such an amazing job of presenting their information even when its an opinion with the goal of providing a balanced perspective  they are engaging but truthful and i always appreciate hearing what they have to say as it regards to current topics  as a social worker it was a no brainer to me to support black lives  but i always felt conflicted about the demonizing of the police by the blm movement  i was told it was wrong supporting both but that felt wrong to me  through this podcast tillman and aj have made me realize its not wrong in fact its absolutely crucial we do support both  this podcast has opened my eyes to the reality of police officers jobs while enforcing my beliefs about the important changes they can be a part of to better our society  thank you officers tillman  aj for the work youre doing to change the world  and aj dont knock your social workers bud thousands are out there dealing with the sweaty naked crazy guys in residential treatment centers  not hoping they will replace police but just know theyre already out there handling those things and have some crazy stories similar to yours  keep it up guys good break down  facts are hard to dispute  as a police officers wife i really appreciate this podcast  your views and explanations of current events and policing are so helpful in understanding what my husband does every day  i really love your wisdom and insights especially as it relates to current events  your podcast has encouraged me and my husband tremendously especially these last few difficult months  thank you for taking the time to do this for us  this is a must listen in todays america  ryan and aj do a great job of laying it all out there for their listeners  they consistently use facts when discussing the challenges and issues of law enforcement social issues and community involvement in an entertaining way every episode  thanks guysp s   billys not bad either thank you guys for your service as police officers  service to communities  you have had some of the best podcasts i have listened to over the past few months  it is one of my go to podcast series  this podcast was so informative about what actually was happening in the entire case  i blame the media for most of whats happening in our country i also have to say that at the end when you talked about critical thinking that is the truth  somehow all media social media especially have hijacked our brains  people cant seem to think for themselves anymore  thank you for laying it out  my son is biracial  is really struggling with all of this  i hope one day he will find your podcasts  we are so far apart on the subject i could never bring it up  sending prayers to you guys everyday my brothers a cop my other sons in the navy i pray for all of you guys  my son thats struggling with his thoughts about all of this   this podcast is for everyone whether in the force thinking about getting into one or a civilian  they are enthusiastic about bridging the gap between civilians and law enforcement and provide excellent insight and wisdom  not to mention they are pretty funny too  ive been listening to you guys for a couple months now and i have had many experiences where i feel so grateful for you guys and for our local law enforcement  i have friends here in my community that are police officers and they are some of the best dudes  i always feel so motivated to want to help our community while listening to you guys  earlier in my life when i had to decide what i was going to do with my life law enforcement was one of those options  i always go back to that time and think what if i would have just gone through it to become a police officer but i feel like i wouldnt have done my best but after listening to you guys and knowing how big of an influence police officers can be that feeling has come back to me  im still hesitant but im looking into a county sheriff reserves program that my friend has been wanting me to look into  thanks for your motivation and for your thoughts and feelings of whats going on in our country  even though its scary out there it makes me proud and motivated to become a part of law enforcement to make a positive change  thanks guys i appreciate the positive messages everyone should listen to this podcast  it will change your perspective about law enforcement 100 if you do not want your status quo to be challenged do not listen to this podcast  as a member of the black community i have intentionally shut myself off from the news and media that floods our consciousness  the thoughts shared in this podcast has challenged me to remain engaged especially if im ever to have an opinion on daily social topics  yes they speak on matters specifically pertaining to policing in america  however theres an overarching focus on the systemic issues that not only have led to the degradation of policing but the diminished lack of respect and care for authority and fellow man  definitely listen and allow yourself to be vulnerable to the heart of the message this podcast delivers  morning ryan aj and billyive been listening to your show for a couple of months since your episode with donutoperator  i enjoy your guys view and conversations about all the recent events  this weeks episode was one of the best  we are truly living in a crazy time for police and even first responders  as the grandson of a retired la county sheriff rodrigo serrano the story of the two ambushed deputies hit my family hard  i grew up in victorville ca my dad still lives there  i just wanted to say keep up the good work guys keep speaking the truth and keep your faith  best wishes and god blessvincent serrano and the serrano family i am hooked on this podcast  i enjoy the positive ness and knowledge it brings  it is refreshing to hear this on my way to work or in the gym  i believe this podcast will bridge the gap for law enforcement and civilians  hands down this is one of the best podcasts out there especially right now ive recommended it several times to people who dont necessarily know the law enforcement side of things so they can have a better understanding of why officers may respond the way they do  its also a great podcast for people in law enforcement or going into law enforcement  there is always an encouraging and uplifting message to be heard  love it very informative and positive  keep up the good work guys you guys are amazing you have helped through so much and you inspire me every day you guys are awesome i came to listen to this podcast because i follow officer a j  and enjoy him but im now turned off by the review on jacob blake in kenosha wi  i understand people should comply but come on there were 3 officers following behind him before he even got to the car he wasnt a big guy why couldnt they tackle him before he even got to the car  it takes 7 shots to stop a threat this is bs yet the kid that had the ar 15 was able to walk right past the police and nothing happened but they didnt mention that then the conversation about breonna taylor with the no knock warrant  yall want to say civilians need more training that may be true but so do police officers dont act like they dont   and it doesnt matter if they shouldnt have been doing something in the first place they have the right to a trial  police arent supposed to be the judge jury  executioner  period  ryan and aj you guys are what i aspire to be as a police officer i just started the police academy a month ago  listening to this podcast makes me feel excited for the line of work i will be entering as a law enforcement officer and makes me want to strive to be better everyday  not just for me but the community i will serve in the near future i listen to this podcast when i drive for work instead of music  this podcast is super informative motivating inspirational and down right funny at times with the banter thank you for taking the time to give your listeners some nuggets golden nugget heidi hamp i wish you were news journalist i loved this weeks episode we do need to be educated you guys are great i so glad that i found you  a fan from the south i love my friends and will talk to them about anything  everyone else maybe  im halfway through the historical podcasts and have linked reviewed or quoted something from every episode  as a christian black cop i let these 3 speak for me on social media while i focus on the things the lord has uniquely tasked me to handle  thank you savage aj and ryan opening my to the world i fear ever interacting with you guys have mention many things i live my life by like the four agreements by miguel ruiz be the change i want to seebeing comfortable with the uncomfortable  lead with love i do not do what you guys do i manage people and also teach preschoolers  i live by the these agreements because the strong commitment i have to myself you guys are strong men keep this up i thoroughly enjoy this podcast  the transparency these officers have is needed  their knowledge their experiences and their realness is all needed i listened to the full episode with rener gracie and i ended up going back from the beginning and listened to all of the podcasts  im currently on episode 38 and i am not going to stop there  i am working my way through a bachelors degree christian counselingpastoral path to become a police officer that a lot of people dont understand  this podcast has helped me so much in so many ways  these three ryan aj and the savageyes hes included have not only reinforced my decisions but have even changed many previous biases ive had with thugs and other people not from the same background as myself  as of this review 772020 this podcast is truly needed in this country  thank you guys keep doing what you are doing and i truly hope to meet you in person one day  these guys are helping us understand how to move forward in todays world must listen to these guys with open minds love it and god bless them my husband began listening when he was in the academy 2 years ago  i began listening recently because in some way it brings me comfort to hear ryan and ajs stories and how their wives are involved  it helps me to better understand how to deal with the profession he chose  you guys are doing some amazing things and i hope the whole world can be reached  the lord knows we need this  god bless i came across officer tillmans breakingbarriersunited instagram page and the content is so great it eventually led me to listening to his podcast because his page is just that good what both these men are doing is a breathe of fresh air  they are the light that the world currently needs and i pray that their voices are heard nationwide  thank you both for all you do and please continue to spread all the positivity and love because itsneeded i am a deputy sheriff in montana and although my community does not share the same struggles as others it is nice to hear good things from good people  nan,50,4.94

tons of content interesting guests bibble is funny but his voice sounds like morning breath  ethan ralph grooms very well  zidan hasnt been in the show in over a year you cant abort the retort its an okay show however the constant reading of super chats and stream labs stops any momentum the show gets  wish there was a more successful way to monetize these shows  if i knew how many hrs of my life have been stuck listening to terrible fanboy superchats i would fall into a deep deep depression and end it all  ralph is the ring leader of the best podcast on itunes  covers politics internet drama conspiracy  everything in between you will find it hard to turn off  sunset me ralph   youre right im already not working so heres your review  change can be rough but this show stays original despite its ups and downs   the host and rotatating cohost all bring something unique to the table and play well off one another   i listen to this show every day at work and it makes the time fly by   youll never peacefully sunset the killstream this is the funniest show for the dissident right the show is more often entertaining then awful  with the audience chats adding a lot of the cringe  the ups and downs with ralph and the other hosts are understandable even with the adition of     sorry andy warski  the best part of any show is flamincos birthday and a large glass of wet water as i listen  its kinda right leaning but ethan ralph will let anyone on the spectrum come on and speak their piece   great for spirited debate and sometimes the funniest show on the podcast app  listen on dlive as

and this show has consistently entertained me for a very long time  there has been a decent amount of controversy scandal and conflict but ethan ralph always finds his way to the top  he has quite miraculously climbed out of the depths of despair live on air  this podcast is uniquely entertaining  topics or people im usually not interested in or wouldnt normally pay attention to is delivered organically and for a wide audience  he wont hold back either  good work  i used to like rand but now he is obnoxious with his constant interruptions and ralph trying to keep him quiet but he just keeps on going finally  a podcast that someone like me a dolphin can understand  thank you  very cool ethan ralph and crew never fail to entertain the show has struggled to find a permanent home for a good part of the year but the podcasts are testament to how good the show is  ralph is a good guy and when hes having fun youll find yourself having a good time  cantaborttheretort killstream ethan

punches pulled it sure is a good time  would give 0 stars if possible  ethan rand and the like pander to the worst of society bringing nazis and white nationalist talking points to the masses  if youre against science and prefer feeling over facts this is the podcast for you  no this show used to be one of my favorites and one of the best on the internet  however this show has turned into straight garbage now  the original cohosts have left the show and there are no more fun segments like there used to be  the main host ethan ralph has become an alcoholic and attacksabuses his fan base and lies about nearly everything and is extremely boring now that he is the only person in the show since he has no content  he also bans or attacks people who call him out on his behavior and he leeches money and viewers off his friends  hes stolen money from his audience in the past and has fallen so far from where he used to be  dont listen to this trash  the news he covers now isnt even the most important news and he doesnt even have any interesting or funny takes  there are far better news shows out there that are far more entertaining and you wont be attackedabused for listening to them  save yourselves the time and dont listen to this gunt i listen to podcasts because theyre an efficient medium for consuming entertainment and news   this podcast isnt informative as is entertaining and i certainly wouldnt pause it when someone talks to me  youre not going to miss out on any intriguing factoid  been watching for a while now and goddamn is ralphs show funny  always

practical steps to move forward because any step no matter how small or big is still a step forward  this episode really spoke to me i also believe my husband is going to find me when the time is

had listened to becky a few years ago i always feel like when i listen to beckys podcast or her other training that shes talking directly to me  shes like a priest giving a homily or a minister giving a sermon and you think oh crap hesshes talking directly to me now the podcast is the same  take this info and do what she says in a way that aligns with you and your business and you will make things

to hear  becky brings to the business world a wealth of experience and knowledge that is both fresh bold honest and practical    above all else however is that she has the clarity of her purpose so embedded in her messages that you have no choice but to take her suggestions implement them into your business and then receive  the results occur    i have always appreciated the no fluff approach that becky provides    if you are ready to action listen to these podcasts and be ready for epic results ive been looking for something like this for awhile  shes a straight talker and doesnt fluff it up with the same cultural nonsense that blurs entrepreneurship and makes it like playing dollhouse for women  im looking forward to the future episodes  so much truth comes from becky  i owe this woman my life  shes helped me change everything about myself and im just getting started   nan,43,4.88372093

955100693,Sermon of the Day,Christianity,Desiring God,955100693,50,123079,tremendous help unfortunately trump proved piper was right praise god trump truly passionate john piper piper is sincere real preaching not a matter of talk but power genesis 1 what a blessing love his sermons sound volume could improve biblically sound truth god s will no really john piper john piper takes you to another level biblically sound forever grateful pretty good glory of god pastor john piper the true christian truth and understanding simply the best life changing what happened one of the very best of out time these will help you grow john piper small request gladness teaching me and inspiring me in my relationship with jesus his passion shows me where i want to be deep thinker most importantly this is a great podcast with solid teaching love piper s passion i understood his opinion about the election but did not agree with him it is unfortunate that trump s character was such a problem that it lead to an insurrection and murder of police i regret my vote for trump even though i hate biden s policies piper was right i thank god for men like john piper and i pray each day that god would find ways to grow and shape and use me in a way for his kingdom pray for faith eyes to see i use to love piper but after his comments about trump and throwing away his right i realized that he thinks he is above others he believes he can judge the heart of man most importantly he doesn t believe what he preaches i despise hypocrisy pharisee pastor john is truly passionate about the lord and i find it encouraging to my faith i have learned a lot and am very thankful for these sermons and the books he has written thank you a new perspective from a man with the holy spirit inspiring encouraging convicting motivating and truthful word that keeps god s glory and grace as 1 just love the setup of the sermons and the analogies he uses john piper is an amazing preacher his sermons have continued to encourage edify and enlighten me over and over thank you father for your son john piper and his faithfulness to interpreting and teaching your word correctly real preaching comes from the bible for the glory of god and that is what this is soli deo gloria to live is christ to die is gain i just listened to the recent podcast titled the greatest thing in the world in which john piper discusses wrath fire and brimstone for about 20 minutes to set up to say we are saved only if we accept jesus while i am glad that he offers this so that we don t need to revert to legalism fundamentalism in order to save ourselves i have to disagree on where we start as humans if you start reading the bible at the beginning doesn t it start with genesis 1 where god creates the world and men women declaring that they are good why can t we start here why can t we communicate that people are good first rather than a sinful sack of garbage first why can t we start with genesis 1 can t we teach people that they are capable of goodness because goodness is where we began isn t it therefore deeply set within us because of our image that we share with the god that created us this podcast is a saving grace during this tumultuous time i listen with my bible open eager to receive god s truth rest in his promises john piper is a tremendously gifted speaker clearly grounded in the word and i am so grateful to have this encouragement for such a time as this such great sermons i wish it was a little louder i drive all day for work and at time i have it turned all the way up and still have a hard time hearing the sermon whenever i need to hear some biblical truth on just about any topic i can always tune in to john piper i m so grateful to have access to these encouraging and challenging messages you can t know jesus until your will is to do god s will and god s will is to make much of himself who are you to say otherwise you will shave your head as penance amazing he is so good these sermons stir me to desire jesus even more john piper s love and passion for god is so clear and contagious i love that these sermons are in itunes thank you and please continue to posting them i am grateful that we have such immediate access to such biblically sound sermons thank you for making this available john piper is one of the greatest theological minds and preachers of our time i will forever be grateful to god for his ministry god has used his preaching to grow my love and desire for him and his glory like no other preacher it is pretty the podcast from today sept 9 is this first one i ve listened to and easily one of my favorite messages ever i cried i examined my heart i worshipped pastor john always points me back to my purpose for being here the glory of god and to make his name great i am absolutely touched and wept in repentance through the two podcasts i have heard thus far pastor john is the true christian his podcasts carry the power of true transformation in the hearts of believers and draw unbelievers to christ the lord opened my eyes to the truth of his word through pastor john god s word has not been presented this way ever before i can sense the lord appealing to the church through pastor john and the work of the holy spirit in his life his podcast messages are annointed by the lord and have the fire of the holy spirit to turn hearts towrds christ and to change the listener to a true and genuine follower of christ our lord may the lord so richly bless pastor john and the church he pastors and may his messages resonate forever on this land as one of the greatest preachers of the gospel of christ so grateful for john piper and in saying that the presence of god in him for the clarity he brings to biblical scripture i have thirsted for preaching like this for so long it is the severity and reality of the destination of sinners with the soft tenderness of love and truth in the hope that jesus provided us an alternate course what a blessing his ministry is to me and to many no words can explain how each sermon makes me feel please please please keep recording them i and i m sure a lot of other people really need your word i have been a christian for 43 years never have i grown deeper in my faith and understanding as i have through pastor john s teachings and books the lord has chosen him for this time in history to proclaim his truth all praise glory and honor be to our god thank you pastor john for your faithfulness i used to get this podcast daily and now it seems to have ended please bring it back these are the best sermons by the best preacher of god s word god s word preached is one of the primary tools the holy spirit uses in our lives i pray that as you listen to these sermons you apply what you hear the gospel is such good news john piper is an amazing servant of god and the way he studies the bible has changed the way i study it every like of scripture is essential and no reading of it is worthless god has used pastor john piper to increase the joy of his word in my life thanks so much for this podcast i love it too i would love it even more if the date of the sermon was listed with each hope

1483329487,Setting the Tone: An ER Retrospective,TV Reviews,Setting The Tone,1483329487,88,378437,really great with minor caveats my new fave podcast awesome podcast new to er big fan i was so excited to see an er podcast especially from people who are my age who watched as kids and revisiting as adults overall i enjoy hearing their takes and love that elizabeth provides great little clips of moments in the show i really needed this podcast right now as a lovely escape i m almost at the end of season one and there is a concerning pattern that keeps emerging initially i was so excited to hear them highlight the smaller extras and call out the ones who went on to more notable screen roles further in their careers it s fun to recognize actors and it reminded me of the podcast i was there too that celebrates extras and character actors here however it seems that actors fall into two camps a nobody or a somebody what s constantly missed are actors who didn t have large screen roles but were career theatre actors like sanford meisner who they did mention his incredible teaching career but made it sound like he never really acted because he had few screen credits it might seem like a small bone to pick but it s become a constant pattern that i can t ignore words like insignificant nobody unremarkable and other rough comments that i don t think are meant to be cruel but come off as such after listening to 20 episodes she didn t go off to do anything i expected to see more credits yikes the commentary about names is also hard to listen after a while consistently referring to someone as having a weird name gets pretty off putting i don t think the intention is to be cruel but weird carries a negative connotation that i don t think this podcast is going for i don t work in entertainment and this isn t about not having an opinion i m here for the critique of episodes and performances and genuinely will keep listening nurse jen stories are a huge highlight and each host brings a unique pov to the show that i appreciate what i m touching on is more about limiting the discussion into more credits you re better and your career choices valid in an industry that s way more complicated than that narrow perspective there s a database for broadway actors that might be helpful literally the internet broadway database cheers and i look forward to breakdowns of all the seasons i started watching er this year after missing the original run for multiple reasons that seem so insignificant now the podcast does a great job transporting you back in time to the week it s aired immersing you in the details of the week that was before walking you through the details of every episode with witty commentary a must listen if you love 90s pop culture and the groundbreaking medical drama love this podcast sooo much i ve watched er since it first aired in 1994 and have seen each episode thousands of time and i love hearing y all talk about them great perspective and great chemistry among y all definitely can t wait for all 300 episodes even though i never had seen an episode of er this show gave me the opportunity to fix that and i m glad i took that opportunity the hosts are excellent and very knowledgeable as a fan of nostalgia podcasts this is a great deep dive in the er series the hosts are well researched and sounds like they are enjoying what they are doing nan,5,4.8

rachael great job love it s finally here rachael o brien does it again excited bold i love this trailer great concept fantastic the stories in this podcast are great and worth sharing but i can t get past the host s dry reading and forced commentary it sounds very unnatural i think she just needs more practice please do not stop i love that you are so real but still funny without this being a comedy podcast i grew up in the bible belt so i knew so many of those evangelical pastors some good but most gave off bad vibes i just really enjoy your podcast i heard about this podcast from morbid and am really enjoying it the host does awesome research and seems to always say what i m thinking about these horrible people i m very picky when it comes to podcasts the voice has to be smooth the tone has to be organic and the content has to be really well researched this podcast checks every one of those boxes the host is energetic without being annoying and each story is interesting and well researched the columbine podcast has details i had never heard before even though i have researched the story myself several times definitely a 5 podcast if only there were more than 7 deadly sins good thing there are plenty of sinners to talk about she goes really in depth and is just amazing is her wording and expressions in her voice love this show this is a quality podcast doing a quality thing pulling the masks off false prophets like an episode of scooby doo and showing them for what the really are keep up the good work fam in love with this podcast it s one of those things that while horrible and heinous by all accounts it s impossible to look away or hear away entertaining and well researched this is one of my favorite podcasts i didn t really like the 1st season something was off about it maybe still finding your groove still it feels like you re just reading off a paper not very engaging if your religious like i am and have a deep faith in christianity this gives an eye opener to how far people will go to munipulate those who don t have any faith and are looking for anything to ease whatever they might be going through especially thoughs who deal with addiction i love this poscast and thank morbid for the recommendation keep strong in your faith and be emroused with the bible so you won t be fooled by false prophets fun to listen to well researched great topics the whole idea behind this podcast is so good i can t stop listening and love the multi parters each episode is so interesting and you can tell a lot of research is put into them it s really hard to do a podcast by yourself but the host does a great job the host is super easy to listen to very charming keep up the good work super interesting content very original jesse morbid made me listen to you glad they did can t wait to hear more i really wanted to like this because i love true crime podcasts and came here from morbid which is my fav but as a christian i found it incredibly hurtful and offensive i know the monsters covered in this show were of religious origin and called themselves christian but that doesn t mean that all christians are like that i was totally off put and cringing listening to you mock the way these people believed in jesus and eternity in heaven who in the church hurt you you sound like you got beef with the faith itself just because people believe in god doesn t mean they are delusional you can cover these cases and these awful people and crimes without mocking the religion and beliefs themselves i can t believe in 2021 people still make fun of others beliefs like this yes some christians are awful and small minded but many of us aren t and just because someone believes doesn t mean they are weak and gullible it was very disappointing because i really wanted to like this podcast amazing frightening all at once love it i was brought to this podcast by morbid and the preview of the alamos i find myself switching to this immediately after catching up on my morbs i m not really a try new podcasts person but now imma go download all the others so i can binge at work p s when she laughs about the harleys in the syanon episode i lost it great podcast and story telling if you are an deconstructed or former evangelical you will appreciate this podcast enlightening fascinating and at times mind blowing the research done on this show is great as is the production is fantastic keep it up heard about this podcast on mordbid and i loveee it i grew up evangelical and am very familiar with the prosperity gospel these mega pastors hide behind thank god someone else sees the hypocrisy in it this podcast makes me realize i was always the sane one found your podcast from morbid love the way you tell these stories fascinating content hard to believe how evil some people are i like that you re able to give updates on how some of the victims are doing today keep up the great work i heard you on morbid and was instantly hooked i ve been binging all of your past shows can t wait for next week as someone who has worked for the church for 3 years now this show has rocked my soul just a little bit the research the talent this show is beyond what i expected and everything we needed to have i know it s not easy being a solo host but everything is so well done officially obsessed with your show thank you rachel i love your podcast you put so much of yourself into this and it really shows one of my favorites really good podcast can t wait for the new ones to come out i binge listened to all you previous episodes i can t take the way that she reads quotes especially for guys it s super weird and i can t take the podcast serious just talk in your regular voice love the singular format great subject matter love can t wait to hear more just finished the tony trashbag alamo lol series and i m hooked so well written and read 5 star worthy podcast for sure i m glad you re telling these stories and you do it so well i found your show via morbid and it was a great find keep it up girl found this podcast from morbid excellent narrator fascinating stories love it currently binging love the show people are so desperate sometimes this proves what i have always believed all episodes are great the catholic church episode was well researched except for mispronounced priestly orders but i keep listening rachael you ve been keeping me on the edge of my seat with these stories i remember visiting at least one of these evangelical churches in the 80s and wondering why i felt like i was invisible there probably because i was poor and couldn t afford to give anything when many of these scandals happened i remember wondering how could this happen and why so many of them at once i m all caught up now snd can t wait to hear what s next keep it coming loving this podcast it s a shame how many stories there are but please keep dishing them out i love your podcast you are very good at telling the story and making it easy to follow i found you on morbid so thankful i did my only issue is i feel you have something against christians yes the people you report on abuse religion but i feel you have something against any christian believers god is real and not all believers are brain washed but you can tell you work very hard on these episodes and you do a great job this could be a great podcast if it weren t for the horrible commentary this chick killed great stories i got to hear about this podcast from morbid omg i binged all episodes because they were so good and these sinners are so bad thank you rachel heard about the hype and i m drinking the koolaid pun intended came over from morbid and sooo glad i did fascinated by the psychology and hosts interpretations behind these cult leaders and their actions and methods love everything bravo you are hilarious love the podcast i listened to your first podcast on the sick pervert named warren jeffs and i was hooked don t stop doing what you are doing so glad morbid gave you a shout out so i could find another amazing podcast to listen too you rock and don t let anyone tell you differently as someone who grew up in the 80 s with parents that worshiped the likes of the bakers and jimmy ray swaggart this opened my eyes to horrors of it all and how much it had an impact on how i was raised i also found you on morbid this is everything i always want in a crime podcast thank you morbid and thank you 7 deadly sins for being awesome i work in the west texas oil fields and i ve listened to soooooo many podcasts as i am a truck driver i use my imagination in a lot of these storylines and you make it really easy to follow with that keep up the great work i love the podcast and yes i heard of you from morbid i have only listened to the first season but i m hooked i heard rachel on morbid and thought i d try it out so glad i did she s funny and as a single podcaster does a great job keeping you engaged i ve decided to start listening to her other podcast once i m done here awesome storytelling heard about you from the morbid ladies and have loved every episode so far learning and laughing and hating everyone of those scum balls you cover dude great pod some rough subjects to get through but fascinating i found this gem through morbid just a few days ago and i m already almost finished listening to all the episodes so good it brought back memories of my mother getting the prayer cards from robert tilton so we ll put together i highly recommend i will say that morbid is the main reason that i found your show awhile back i love your attitude and the stories you cover are often pushed under the rug but i am glad you re shining light on these terrible people love you i ve always loved you girl but this pod is fireeee you ve got a gift for this and i m so stoked for you it s a perfect mix of your funny quick witted charm all the while still respecting the seriousness of these horrible crimes you have the best personality not too many can carry a podcast solo but you sure can discovered this gem thanks to the morbid pod incredibly interesting content and hilarious commentary let the binging begin i would never have listened but for the recommendation from morbid one episode in and i was hooked not so much about the topic no opinion either way but you are a fantastic storyteller i have been binging for a couple of days now and fear when i am caught up keep up the great work stories are amazing production is good but she clearly has some personal church hurts that impact her story telling i have been bingeing this since hearing about it on morbid it is excellent and i would highly recommend it very cool well researched and put together honestly the choice of backing music is all over the place and insane to me but it keeps me on my toes i just started listening this week and it is awesome thanks rachael i ve just started listening to this podcast after hearing about it on morbid i don t understand why the narration is so quiet while the background music and ads are normal volume frustrating because i listen while at work and have to put both airpods in to even hear all of the actual podcasts and still on full volume it s hard to hear some of the content i don t have this issue with any other podcast good content though love your attitude dj is perfect i wouldn t have heard about your show except for the morbid podcast sharing meetings with other podcasters during our extreme lock down while you noted it s hard to do alone that is not apparent in your episodes excellent research and narrative and unapologetic view of a controversial subject i was riveted please keep doing your show it s fascinating to hear the details of these events i ve lived through i m 60 and am hooked on some of them were new to me excellent and well researched show rachael s new podcast is so good she s well prepared and well spoken also i love that she adds opinions in there and still shows her personality also the music is perfect it s spooky in the best way very well researched and entertaining great show rachel has an amazing way of telling these stories she has just the right amount of snark that these stories truly deserve there are stories i have never heard of and they are captivating i just started listening to you this podcast today because i heard about it from morbid and i love it your voice is soothing and so aggressive like some single podcasters don t love the music that plays in the background it s distracting the topics are good though it s got everything facts dark humor about dark topics amazing storytelling i am in love i stumbled onto your podcast after the recent morbid episode i just finished your three parter the matt baker case and i m hooked you re doing great thanks for creating great job i m loving the content and delivery i just binged all of the episodes that are available in like 3 4 days and i can t get enough rachel does such a great job telling these stories and her descriptions of these people are hilarious and spot on especially those of matt baker lol i can t wait for episode 4 of the tony and susan alamo story oh and by the way as someone who sat by my sister in law and watched her succumb to stage 4 metastatic breast cancer you do not mess around or lie about having cancer karma always gets you in the end heard about this show on morbid and now i can t stop listening love this host not aggressively production y voice which can be hard to find in true crime podcasts and amazing integration of music love the stories so much information is awesome nitty gritty too such a queen rachael never disappoints her other podcast be here for awhile has been a fav of mine for years now looking forward to more content from such a brilliant and kind hearted person amazing and funny sad that i am familiar with the prosperity movement i really enjoy this podcast the host is hilarious glad the morbid girls recommend it it s hard to hear the facts of the stories over your editorializing very interesting topics it s just hard to hear the story with your outrage dripping from every statement the subjects deserve the outrage they are monsters it s just hard to understand the story the way you tell it i heard about your podcast on morbid i m so glad because your show is amazing love it the narration needs a lot of work very choppy and inconsistent cadence and intonation frustrating can we talk about your intro song for a second lol i love it i love this podcast the topics are great and the way she explains things speaks right to my soul she s not afraid to speak her mind and point out the atrocities of these people i love that this podcast often has such whacky subject matter that it s often split into multiple parts gives me something to look forward to week after week as a religious person i can see how the manipulation works on vulnerable people i appreciate the episodes because it keeps me aware of behaviors that could be leading to impropriety or worse abuse leaders can behave badly in many ways and those of us in the pews need to guard our hearts and souls this is hard to listen to but very necessary thank rachel and greg for doing this hard work i love this podcast the topics and cases are very interesting and well researched and there s the perfect balance of information and host input i look forward every week can t wait for more i love this podcast so much i was turned on to it by alaina and ash from morbid and season 1 sucked me in i didn t know how season 2 could top it but it has brilliantly written and stories that must be told you will not be disappointed i love the concept of this show and the stories are interesting the trouble i have is with the grating host she comes across ironically as very self righteous given the theme not sure if i can continue listening oh just wrote a review and realized that i found them because of morbid podcast that s a great one too great podcast to put on the morbid network great job all around ladies somehow rachel turns a messed up story into a fun and easy listen definitely one of the most unique podcasts i ve listened to in terms of delivery love it rachel tells these stories so naturally it s easy to see the genuine interest and disgust she has for these for lack of a better term subjects love the podcast and so glad it s part of the morbid network one of my favorite pod cast for sure rachel is awesome and this pod cast is so well done i have binged every episode and can t wait for more very interesting topic and well done i wasn t too sure at first but grew on me right away i am interested in the topic but i cannot listen due to the mega annoying distracting loud foreground music i just started listening to your podcast and i am hooked thank you for telling the true stories of these false preachers and keep up the greed work i will be listening and waiting for each new podcast love the content but the intermittent music during the podcast was very distracting for season 2 i started listening to this podcast after morbid announced it as a part of their podcast network i binged season one immediately and i am so excited to start listening to season two this podcast is produced soooo well i would definitely recommend thank you so much for shedding light on this all this this show sheds so much truth omg i have a new gem in my life that i did not know i needed thisssss especially a kid who grew up in the church and was raised

off as regular guys that would be fun to hang out with   big joes one liners are so well timed and hilarious  the vegas confessions tapes were really good  it made us all feel like we were there   thanks for all you do and please keep it up  gigemwilliam in fort worth this is my first review i think ive ever left for anything  i looked up podcasts about craps and wanted to listen about different strategies and tips etc  listened to the first episode and loved it but it wasnt what i was looking for so i listened to several other podcasts about craps and gambling  never made it through an entire episode of the other guys  im now 14 episodes in and ive decided that strategies for craps are probably like butt holes anyway and every one has one but these stories are pure gold thank you for the laughs and entertainment if you enjoy gambling youll enjoy this podcast  i have never been to ac or play poker but still find the gambling stories and advice solid  fun to hear great friends just bs and talk about something they love gambling i cant believe even stevie mandimes voice is a ten one of the premier podcasts out there for the recreational gambler like myself  never

of the stories surrounding ac and vegas  with most people now seeing ac as a place that has seen better days and is past its prime it is refreshing to hear stories of guys who are still enjoying all that ac has to offer  plus who doesnt love a good man soup i thought i was addicted to sports betting and craps  then i started listening to this love the show you guys are hysterical  going out to vegas for the first time on july 5th so really excited  thanks for the entertainment guys  one of the best gambling podcasts out there  its just two dudes talking about whatever and however under the

the midwest but am ready to go  wow   so happy i found this show  great story telling about casino visits  makes you feel like you are there  1 hour on stair master seems like 10 min  thank you  love this podcast  love the tales from the podcast segments  these guys arent here to teach strategy or gloat about how much they win  its really more of a collection of gambling stories that you like

in ten mins ya great asmr to fall asleep to great but please bunch ads at beginning hi bad whispers boom uhhhhhhh great his voice is soothing hear me out i love slept like a baby wow love the meditation and guided sleep scary as hell ads great but can me improved i love it really helps me get to sleep  really works do not recommend great double success hello loud and interrupting ads love it great i hate this footsteps nice pass amazing i love it great really good great very relaxing dont loud commercials asmr used to be great 1110 brilliant fascinating great quality  super good qulaity works for me asmr great content mouth sounds this asmr is good i like it im 11 and before i found this i was up all night till like 536 in the morning and couldnt sleep but when i found this asmr it helps me sleep  also i like the cats purring its really nice and calming i have two cats and a dog so it makes me feel like my cat is right next to me thx for making asmr4 7  5bye this podcast is really good for sleep because the host has a super soft voice and i love the different sounds you never think would be soothing  thomas wisconsinsp s i i would like to request a podcast of someone walking with flip flops on i really like that sound  this podcast is part of my wind down routine after a hectic day  the  soothing and calm voice sets the tone for nighttime  i  love this podcast because of its wide variety of eclectic episodes  keep them coming  this is one of the best sleep podcasts i listen to at night and it is so amazing i can fall asleep right away when i listen to this you are ugly the worst probably a 4 or5 kid you are probably bully or a mean boy or girl and more so if your a hater and you see this i dont know what your talking about this podcast is the best and the greatest so 1010 so this podcast is the best i think you should not be popular be bullied back from the people you bullied sooooooo yo momma probably mean to you yo bro can you please calm down with the hate comments not to be mean you should just have a bad ending on your story so yap s this is the best podcast this podcast has helped me with my anxiety and with getting off my phone and just relaxing and feeling like i have a friend there at night when im alone  i love the informative and trivia ones in speaking voice  roses are redviolets are bluea face like you belongs in a zoodont be mad ill be there tonot in a cage but laughing at youin other words your asmr is trash this podcast is amazing  i fall asleep to the main mans voice every night  my favorite episodes are the facts trivia and wiki page episodes  i enjoy how he speaks on the slower side and how he really annunciates his words  i highly recommend to relaxfall asleep to if youre having issues  speed reading is not relaxing   felt like i was listening to an auctioneer  can we slow it down a little  this might have been a decent story if i could have understood what i was hearing  in this stressful time in the world i have such a difficult time turning my brain off when i go to bed  the whispered rambles are exactly what i need thank you so i was looking at erotic asmr and i found the on the list of it and i was like huh anyways 4 stars i love your stuff but its not good that your on erotic asmr is it ples more whisperssoft talkingtalking please lately its been all natureatmospheric which i do appreciate but missing the soothing voice sounds  great asmr podcast  i especially like the guided meditation episodes  i agree with other reviewers that there should only be ads at the beginning though  all i can say is this is not the best asmr podcast but it wasnt that bad  the male i tried out for my first foray into whispering is hopefully not a typical example   while the intro sales pitch is nice and short his performance is marred by 1 loud mouth breathing with no mute to prevent the distraction of his suspenseful air intake  will he make it 2 he loudly clears his throat  3he mispronounces words and pauses then corrects himself in a flustered manner 4 his reading pace is very fast  5 tgres a loud squeak right in the middle   the episode i chose for length was a reading of a wiki 1300s parliament proceedings   suitably boring but poorly whispered   all in all not audible quality  i like this one a lot honestly i dont know how i feel about it   its a step up from others where they just ramble the whole time but this kinda makes me feel weird omg this is great i had a stomachache and couldnt fall asleep till i turned this on such a nice whisper and its so relaxing definitely recommendthank you so much  love that bois voice day 1 so far so good slept like a baby  day 2 couldnt sleep dont know why  this pattern went on for weeks and finally ive come to just sleeping with only a white noise machine i love i love i lovehelps me fall asleep went from 1 hour to 15 minutes your whisper is the best knocks me out and i wake up with my airpods lost in my sheets somewhere i get the best deepest sleep ive ever had thanks to you keep up the amazing hard work my sister finally went to sleep i listen to those two sessions almost daily  sooo relaxing i use them during accupuncture or on a long flight or just in bed to drift off so fast  thank youps would love a new guided meditation oh god no i cant stop seeing things kill me idiots go die stop ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cmon i give this a 45 just because u have to the ads at the beginning  its still great except that the water sounds and like other sounds are kinda loud  to make your podcasts better lower the sound and take out the ads  i love the topics you choose  these are great for bedtime  i often listen to episodes on repeat    always one of my favorite downloads  very relaxing voice and sounds  i have been looking for a while for just the right voice  ive found it  soothing relaxing  calming  just perfect thank you seriously grateful for the sleep meditation i havent been able to sleep fully in weeks and it put me to sleep in minutes  thank god for yall i saw asmr and thought this was going to be relaxing but it is the opposite  asmr is supposed to be relaxing and soothing not loud disrupting and especially scary  if you are trying to be relaxed or go to sleep i dont recommend  great great content with a wide variety each week host comes across very friendly and is dedicated to the episodes  the ads can be a little loud sometimes  worth the listen for anyone who loves asmr  ps id love an episode where you read our reviews softly spoken  hi i love your podcast and i would like you to stop the whisper and more roplays also can you read a book pls read a book like esperanza rising or the one and only ivanalso please respond bye bye  i get that ads can be necessary but you take too long with them in the beginning  then as i was about to fall asleep and the episode was ending another loud ad is thrown at you  it completely throws you off and takes you out of any relaxation state youre in  i love this podcast so much  i listen to it every night when i go to bed  i love the ramble episodes where i focus on the words and just turn off that little voice in my head that never stops going the only thing i would want more of are the ones where you use the same volume in the rambles as you do in the one where you go through all of the countrys just a soft kind sounding voice  overall live the podcast highly recommend i really hate that it talks but i love the crackling fire its so relaxing it helps me sleep i hope you could make more its so horble to sleep with and how im i spouse to sleep with i was so excited to hear the footsteps episode  that is one of my favourite sounds  i have never found a good one  i ended up being disappointed with this one as well   the footsteps never walked away receding in volume  they simply stayed in one place as if the person wasnt walking at all  ineffective  i really liked the deep meditation one  you said you were gonna change your voice volume a bit but i couldnt tell  maybe if you whispered i might have fallen asleep right at the end  you should do more guided meditation sessions or tapping on things  those are great too i find this dude creepy  i dont like how he says i want you on your back this the best asmr podcast i have found i love it so much and fall asleep to it every night i like it it definitely helps me sleep through the night but the loud popping and foot steps wake me up every time great i love it  i love the awesome asmr it is so relaxing i would recommend this to anyone but the adds in the beginning bug me a bit    but forget the adds and i encourage the owner of the podcast to keep doing asmr besides the very loud ads this podcast is one of the best but i do suggest turning down the volume of the ads if you are able to  they have woken me up multiple times  this is all stolen from youtube you can hear the loud obnoxious ads at the beginning yes commercials  theyre not ads for products or sponsors    they now have commercials that are so loud that the subsequent asmr is totally pointless  its an interesting but calming way to relax  this show used to be so relaxing and put me right to sleep but now the loud ads that break in completely ruin it  his voice is a nice warm texture like maple syrup and he is very descriptive  nice sounds very crisp and calming  i feel like im there with him my favorite is walking on a rainy day with an umbrella episode 115 on june 14 2017  the sound of a railroad crossing on a rainy night     and all kinds of readings and meanderings to choose from     lovely relaxing sounds and voices      love this podcast   some episodes are recordings of soothing backgrounds some are soft spoken     i especially enjoy the gift spoken commentary as the gentleman is funny clever and altogether lovely to listen to  so soothing this guy has really great mic quality  although i wish he would whisper a bit more he still has some great content  another thing that i like is that he responds to emails very quickly  i am a regular listener   this works as asmr for me better than any other content ive found  love this thank you love the different ideas another useless facts episode would be great i like the mouth sounds and when he swallows his saliva  good asmr for me  nan,62,4.064516129

doesnt help me fall asleep gives me anxiety annoying creepy i would legit give this no stars  ughhh dont listen to the shampoo one with headphones in    wishing eh    its just not bad decent this is a huge nope  almost there soothing no  professional quality repetitive and generic amazing r0gman is thankful helps me sleep thatonedaisyface199806 best way to sleep great asmr fantastic quality and triggers melting relaxing and sleep inducing lifesaver the intro is way too long  despite what some people say i actually quite like it  everyone is aloud to have their own opinion  i personally enjoy this asmr and you should definitely listen to the ones where he reads the poems  sure he could do better but i mean cant we all i really like it and it helps me go to sleep but its obvious its not for everyone because theres a lot of hate comments   all informationroblox bootejuiceamong us ramenslither io bootejuiceyoutube noneinsta nonephone number  tehehe loladdress yahhh nope ima stop here  caution     every one knows this pandemic is crazy every one stay safe and dont touch your face 6 ft apart  this is just freaky and his voice almost scares me for asmr  just nobody listen to this listen to vizzion asmr  also at the beginning of the episode is starts by him almost screaming in a normal voice thats not asmrqueen also this is super gross ugh  queen to except the truth  also whats your roblox i keep seeing you write reviews on here and i wanna friend you  my roblox user is noodlezforlifez  have a great day yall i am not triggered by asmr not everybody is  but i know for a fact that this will not help most people  read the other reviews if they read the reviews    they just say screw em and continue making the horrible episodes almost nobody likes please stop  there is another podcast not by sleep with silk or any asmr channel that does relaxing sleepinducing stressrelieving sounds like lowstoft waves several episodes of rivers and streams wind chimes birds and a ton more  the sounds are crystal clear completely free and with no introductions  just a pure hour of calming nature sounds  they have no voices whatsoever no weird  mouth noises from spacing words spit clacking together and swallowing so close to the mic they go on for a couple minutes after an hour too  the name of the podcast is atmosphonic  they dont have as many viewers as this mostly because nobody knows about it check it out  this is one of the most annoying and uncreative podcasts ive ever run into  the iceberg lettuce episode was just crunching lettuce the same way for 30 minutes  even typing this review is better asmr than some of this crap  it needs to be better  1  be more creative 2  dont do the same thing throughout the whole episodeenjoy your day i dont have any words to describe this  it does not help me fall asleep  ive tried over and over again to try and fall asleep to this podcast  but it has never happened   i do not like when you talk at the beginning of the podcast  your voice is not welcoming and doesnt make me feel relaxed  i mean i never have listening to this podcast  thank you for reading this  have a great daynight    does everyone get an erection from asmr or am i one of the lucky ones              les couchon  i cant fall asleep im trying to find something that helps me when i wake up at 3 oclock in the morning like i did today these are horrible  all i can hear and concentrate on is the speakers exaggerated pronunciation of every word  they need to relax their words so the listener doesnt hear the exaggerated last two letters of every word  they also need to move away from the microphone because i can hear their tongues and their lips and their swallowing all smacking together to form a most annoying noise  they need to speak a little faster with less pause in between each word  all it does is keep me awake too much smacking and swallowing i dont know why i found this creepy the whispers just feels uncomfortable ok listen people  i listen to same a lot  clearly  there should be this much repetition  it makes me stressed  not peaceful  and definitely not relaxed  the shampoo treatment podcast legit hurts my ears  do not listen to it  you can do much better  stop repeating and start being creative  i definitely dont need you to stop i just need a bit more from you  felt like crawling in my ears its doesnt feel good in my mind or my ears i love this so much  it helps me fall asleep a lot when i need to sleep  i hope they make a lot more videos  specifically more virtual spa podcasts   1 star isnt fair but    this gets so repetitive in your episodes    i tried this out and since so many other people seem to like your podcast then i definitely dont think you should stop    but i think so far that bluemind asmr has u beat for me    maybe if u do a variety of different tapping sounds and also episodes then ill try this out again but for now this isnt for me this podcast is so relaxing but the sounds like in the wood paper and matches are repetitive and that can annoy me but its not too bad i listen to this every now and then either when im a little stressed or cant fall asleep too well  i listen to this podcast at nighttime after a long grueling day of work  i recommend this if youre fine with hearing the same sounds over and over again  i also recommend skipping the introduction cuz its longgggggg but this is still great and i enjoy hearing these sounds i love asmr    but this is not really what i am into i was already fairly relaxed when i found this podcast  but listening to only two episodes reversed that feeling quickly  maybe its just me but i found the content to be unsettling and even at times scary  not exactly how i want to fall asleep  it just wasnt for me  i love the podcast but when they tap they do the same thing over and over again just some constructive criticism i love the last episode with the guy reading poems  so relaxing  he has such a quiet voice but you can still hear his voice  wish there were more episodes with him  tried listening to two different ones and both were in no way relaxing  surprising how well this works i tried several episodes but couldnt make it through even one  something about this is just off  disappointing  their other podcast  sleep with silk nature sounds  is much better  very calming and triggers are super relaxing and meditative   its unbelievable one of the best asmrs ive listened to  i was stuck in a endless insomniac mode of no sleep this podcast relaxes me like no other now i sleep very soundly and wake up refreshed really helps to get my mind off the stress of the day and relaxes me so i can sleep very well done and high quality asmr podcast this is one of my favorite podcasts available its very well thought out and its clear a lot of effort goes into it not to sound like pure loops  keep up the good work i have always had trouble sleeping and this podcast has been able to magically induce sleeping within 10 minutes of starting it  i cant imagine sleeping without it  great podcast source of asmr  verity of triggers and really relaxes you into a calm state great podcast for both relaxing and tingles  it has a nice variety of triggers its not locked into just one type of sound so you can find ones you like  the sound quality is great too  its really nice to have an easy option other than youtube for finding asmr sounds  definitely recommend checking out this podcast  i dont know how it works but these podcasts make me feel like im melting into my bed  very relaxing  i love the sleep with silk series and this is probably my favorite of the bunch  i used to watch youtube videos for asmr but after finding this podcast i listen to nothing else  it is extremely relaxing and never fails to help me fall asleep  over the last year i have become used to listening to asmr videos as i fall asleep  most of the asmr content is on youtube  a major downside is that i cant get to sleep when im on the go or in a hotel with bad wifi  on a trip to china i made was frantically trying to get around the firewall to get to my normal videos and get some sleep i gave my podcast app a shot and gave sleep

1099690502,Sleep with Silk: Binaural Beats,Alternative Health,ASMR & Insomnia Network,1099690502,2,314,okay great im speechless    i wish this guy would talk more    grateful re one star reviews too quiet too quiet relaxes me after long day natural way to sleep great simple and great surprisingly soothing happy this guy is around  terrific i do like the binaural beats because they do help me relax but i absolutely hate the fact that you cant use them without headphones please whoever does this podcast fix the audio i wanna hear it without jamming headphones in my ears  i looked up how to use this podcast correctly and i have been doing whatever mr  google said to do get stereo headphones sleep headphones or apple earbuds  i use this podcast when im bored or tired  everybody says bad stuff about the voice and im over here saying wha what his voice is great even though the sleep with silk soothing voices doesnt work for me    often when they are not the ear to ear episodes i get a mild headache  its relaxing alright but doesnt do it for me  it makes me sorta uncomfortable for some reason and idk why  just why i like this podcast his voice is so comforting  i listen with my sleepphones coincidentally advertised here  so happy i found this podcast its well hosted and effective slept within 15 minutes  binaural beats require headphones to be effective  brain science aside the core concept is that one tone is played back isolated in one ear and a slightly different tone is played back isolated in the other ear  some beats incorporate a panning of sounds between the left and right channels  you cannot listen to this podcast or binaural beats in general through stereo or mono speakers downmixed into mono in headphones or in only one ear  you must use stereo headphones to get the intended effect from binaural beats  after a few days of use of several sleep and focus beats on here i believe whats offered here for free compares favorably to beats you can purchase elsewhere  these are unbelievably quiet  idk how anyone can hear a thing without headphones in and id never be able to sleep with head phones  i was very interested in trying this out and then very disappointed to find the even with my volume on max i have to have the speaker pressed against my ear to hear a thing   ill grant that i have a protective case that muffles sound but thats hardly unique   since im not going to sleep either wearing headphones or with my head tilted to press against my phone i guess i cant use these  be sure to listen to this one with headphones really relaxing and the perfect cure after a stressful day i have tried a variety of sleep inducing methods including various medicines and relaxing videos however no way has worked better then listening to the sleep with silk podcast series  i use binaural beats as a way to focus on my studies and to focues on sleeping straightforward podcast that doesnt message around and gives your great relaxation bringing sounds  ive used binaural beats for sleep and meditation before but they can be so hard to find without added noises and sounds  i love just the clean tones  i dont really understand how these work but they definitely do for me  if youve never used binaural beats before go in with an open mind and try this podcast  i wasnt sure about this at first but after listening for a while i realized that my mind had stopped racing and i was very relaxed  very interesting it may be simple but its exactly this straightforward no frills format thats relaxing  binaural sounds are cool for the office where you want to relax and block out your coworkers bs   i just started trying this podcast after listening to the other podcasts in this series  its a great change from the regular talking podcasts and i use this at least one or two nights a week  nan,15,4.133333333
1066154319,Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds,Alternative Health,ASMR & Insomnia Network,1066154319,32,41516,greatest podcast ever for me anyway horrible love it  its been too long  longer episodes longer episodes please great podcast decent not that great well    worstpodcastever every time a intro happens loved it very calming bad great podcast  worstpodcastintheworld great i dont like this  i dont like it good until hmmm why goodbut it would be better wo the voice cant here missing downpour i cant really  relaxing     would be great wo the voice umm    ok rain w thunder love it  love this its very useful relaxing highly recommended puts me right to sleep please no voice intro than you love it best podcast to sleep comforting sounds use this to go to bed every night  help for the sleep deprived great for relaxing  unwinding very helpful complete perfection love this i listen to this podcast literally every night  for some reason whenever i listen to this podcast i always dream about my favorite show miraculous tales of ladybug and cat noir if you watch miraculous and your an adrienette shipper you should be my best friend   not even kidding very creepy needs a update dude asked for my address i really like the episodes of just pure beautifulness  it really helps me sleep they are nice and relaxing and are really peaceful   great way to help me sleep at night not to loud very soothing and it help calm me down i cant really describe the rest in words thanks i love the cat prrr episode but 2019 they have waited too long and i feel bad if they passed away  its too loud i dont like when its talking at the beginning and i like to read reviews and theyre not good these work great for me but they are really short and also the intro kills me   kinda annoying to be honest  other than that the variety and quality seem good to me  i like the sounds because they are soothing but could you maybe loop them personally i have to go through two or more episodes to get to sleep because it takes me a long time to get to sleep  it would be very convenient to have looped audio for like an hour or longer so i could listen to the same sound trying to get to sleep  but so quiet i like it but        the into is anoying  tho its great although they are sleep sounds some of them dont work and havent had new episodes on i dont like how there is talking at the beginning it wakes me up when im asleep  if you are just reading for a few minutes it might work but for sleep it is hard  but besides that the sounds are good for helping me fall asleep  so i dont like nature sound and all the episodes are annoying because its super loud  my ears hurt every time i go to listen i look and it says 1 hour to 8 hour no intro and every time theres a intro i slept like a baby i loved this because i have insomnia helps me sleep bad makes me sleep walk my parents tell me i love it you whisper just fine  dont listen to these twits  worst podcast ever  it is extremely loud i cant even tell you how annoying this podcast is  i always go to sleep very late and so this always helps me go to sleep  so thank you for putting this rushing stream sound together bc it rly helps me to relax  idc what other ppl think but i think this is great once again thank u so much silk nature sounds for making this   bless all yall that are reading this and have a nice day baiiii  it is a very loud podcast  not very calming   it always wakes up my brother  then it will take forever to get him to sleep  if this is a really good podcast why is it sooo annoying i am deleting this from my library  i cant describe how much i hate this podcast  i would rather die than listen to this  i dont know why i put this in my library  why did i press 5stars if you want a real podcast to help you sleep relax or just block out noises  go to atmosphonic they have no talking in any episode at all and the noises are clearer  i feel guilty    i dont like to do hate reviews thats why i put two stars instead of one  hope this helps  btw you can also try sleepy by otis gray  he reads classic books in a soothing relaxing monotone voice to help you sleep  if you have children or you are a child stories podcast might be a good choice  bored try the podcast the past and the curious atmosphonic sleepy stories podcast and the past and the curious are all kid friendly adults listen too  no i am not a paid advertiser    im nine  just tryin to be helpful     also stay inside  coronavirus gonna get ya   atmosphonic as i said has no talking at all  what i forgot to mention all of atmosphonics episodes are about two minutes over an hour and theyre free its was ok but when the sounds came and kept on going it was getting boring  i like sleep tight relax better its good but can like the dude be quieter or like whisper  its not really relaxing when you hear someone like talk loudly i was really hoping to hear the ocean  when i listen to it and try to relaxsleep the voice always make me like whaso it would be better wo them also i cant find the 18 hr ones anywhere soooo im pretty curious about where they are  i get that its supposed to be soothing but cant hear it did you remove some of your nature sounds i found the one that i could count on for sleep  always  it was a subtle rain downpour and its missing  bummed me out  i cant get past the episode of the cat licking itself  makes my skin absolutely crawl and i just cant  also episodes arent long enough for my liking  just not my cup of tea i just love its sounds as it slowly drifts me off to sleep i just love its feeling of getting sleepy after a stressful day  these sounds are all really nice and relaxing and definitely help me sleep    but i cant plet it play from episode to episode as i sleep just because of the creepy voice i like this podcast but the sounds are really repetitive and not always relaxing  i enjoy listening to this its just not very calming  i love this episode but every time the thunder bangs i jolt awake  maybe make the thunder a little lighter in the track  it scares the bejebbes outta me everytime  soothing and helps me fall asleep  i can fall asleep in ten minutes with this podcast  i suffer from insomnia and have a very hard time getting into a deep sleep or a decent sleep for that matter  this podcast especially the rain episodes have helped me get into a routine of deeper sleep and stay asleep for longer  i always fall asleep within 15 minutes of turning this on and it has been a huge lifesaver  thanks for putting these episodes out to help people that could use it very grateful i love having the variety of the choices even though i mostly listen to downfall with thunder and other water ones  my only complaint is that the cat purring one is too stressful and is the fastest purring cat ive ever heard  i can get used to it but it would be nice if there was a more relaxing version  having insomnia is the worst however i find the sounds of rainfall waterfalls and high winds very soothing  only thing i can really do without is the intro voice  freaks me out  i have anxiety so its hard for me to sleep at nighttime  i tried using other podcasts to help me and i noticed anytime it thunderstormedrained i got much better sleep  this is overall the best podcast to use but not only for sleep but it also helps me calm down  keep up the good work d i love this podcast  to me it sounds like it has layers and layers of different water sounds  it usually takes me about 20 minutes to fall asleep lifesaver  especially when i have anxiety attacks  well most of the time anyway  i love 24 but i hate the voice intro  hate more that it wants to play next a commercial with more voice that always wakes me up  needs to be sound only and twice as long i have a hard time sleeping once i stayed up to 600 am but with this i can go to sleep in minutes i fall asleep really fast when i listen to this this podcast is great  soft talking at the beginning then just the sounds in the title  i definitely use this and download them all  listen to this podcast for sleep or for white noise  this is so great it brings me back to my childhood growing up in northern montana and experience the drama of all seasons through sounds my daughter requests this podcast before bed and when she needs some sound comfort  very beautiful and beneficial  its a necessity really like this podcast  i have trouble sleeping but this is a huge help some feedback1  more rain related podcasts would be awesome2  a bit longer podcast as well for those of us whom may wake up in the middle of the night   this podcast helps me to relax so that i can go to sleep without tossing and turning and worrying about the world outside of the little safe place called my side of the bed  i highly recommend this podcast for those who lay in bed and worry about the problems of the world or what someone did or said at work   anything  it erases your cares away and takes you somewhere else where you have no cares and you can rest for a bit of time  we dont get enough of that in our busy worlds  this is a simple and straightforward podcast that has saved me from countless sleepless nights  i love the various combinations of sounds and their quality  definitely recommend if you are looking for something to have as soothing background noise  i love that this podcast exists  i use it on sleepless nights like tonight and it always helps  i love its helped me with my anxiety and helps me sleep this is perfect starry night with crickets knocks me out love love love nan,50,3.84

still around and providing us with excellent material good for sci fi addicts a great podcast once but not anymore past it s prime the format hosts changes hurt this show this used to be good a must listen podcast you ll want more than 1 slice great show and love the format one of my favorites slice of scifi love great stuff listen in my top 5 bought an ipod to listen to this two shows in one both a lot of fun one of the few fun and entertaining this podcast keeps me up to date on all things sci fi must listen incredible podcast well worth your time been listening for years lots of fun and interesting a podcast for true science fiction fans show is terrible now what are you kidding me i miss summer great show makes me laugh out loud in public consistently good fun and informative sci fi fanboy and fangirl central and fan man and fan woman excellent source of sf news too many fillers too many commericals a good program but great interviews great news great voicemail shows great podcast pretty much one whole hour of complaining what more could you ask for best sci podcast ever excellent podcast enjoyable and informative the only sci fi podcast you need fabulous a must listen if quality matters to much can t take it joust it s joust essential it s suffered some since evo left one of the best michael and summer are the best is there a big feed come on its free but one of the few podcasts i listen to excellent podcast great source of information you get what you pay for a middling show all the scifi news you need to know it s becoming more of a horror podcast then a sci fi podcast i do not like it when they mix the two together i love horror too so don t get me wrong but i want sci fi on a sci fi podcast slice of sci fi has enjoyed incredible longevity due to the dedication and passion of summer brooks and her team from in depth interviews with fascinating creators to informative behind the scenes coverage slice of sci fi should be on the playlist of any fan of speculative genres summer continues to be entertaining informative as well as arrange fascinating people to interview many geeky topics are discussed but if for example you ve ever wondered how an indie or horror convention was set up or how films get made on a budget this is a podcast for you conventions sci fi charities of all kinds are reviewed discussed geeked over spock freddie ivanova i m sure would approve it s so good to hear my slice once more i really love this show summer thank you for all your hard work the title says it all keep it up michael glad to hear sam as well focused mainly on media sci fi movies and tv as opposed to books this is an enjoyable frequent show that includes commentary an interviews i pick whether i will listen based on the subject simply because i no longer have the time to listen to every episode i enjoy the team that s been put together and i like the call in show as well full of characters i used to love this podcast however rather than the hosts talking with each other and the listeners and reading news stories it s now filled with long boring third party promotional clips to make it even worse they re usually video clips in an audio podcast i now find myself fast forwarding through episodes or lately just not bothering too bad this used to be one of my favorite podcasts i used to love this show heck i loved most of the stuff farpoint media produced it inspired my own podcasting career but something happened the heart and humor is gone those who made this show what it was are now missed evo and brian they seem to be trying too hard to be a professional mainstream sci fi talk show and have become too sterilized whatever happened please find what made this great return to it and embrace that i miss my old slice i used to listen to slice of scifi religiously it was a good show with a questionable voicemail show that i tolorated to an extent heck i even complimented them on the format changes how getting shows 3 days a week was a good move but it was the same show then something happened and it seemed like the hosts took the changes too far brian brown was excused with no reason i had to tweet the feed to find out why and i was glad they responded given and the worst thing was the show started going almost every day i m sorry but this isn t a show that needs to be every day one of the nice things about being twice a week was it was the right enough dose of the wittiness and banter without being overkill i started actually getting tired of this show and unsubscribed and i didn t think that would ever happen it s one thing to change the format of the show but what really got me was not giving a reason on the air for brian s departure when he s been there longer than anyone there other than michael this used to be a good informative show about sci fi that was until they underwent some changes in hosts and format now it has devolved into delusional fandom and a cheering section for third rate sci fi shows the squeeling and screaming from one particular host needs to stop this is one of the first podcasts i listen to every day if there is a new episode it s the first thing i listen to wish i had time to do the video podcast but they always make sure that it is an enjoyable listen this podcast is intelligent funny and manages to cover all the current sci fi news you could need even the beloved classic shows of the past get their time managing to cover all these angles isn t easy but these hosts know their stuff everything trending in the genre will show up here as well as everything you might have heard is on the way from the doctors new companion to which superhero you may love their all covered here at one time or another great cast guys keep up the good work bytewrite on twitter great show and love the format when you guys gals suggest a show that is how i find out about them through sosf i have seen misfits being human prefer us version continuum eureka 4400 lost girl and so many other shows i guess it is time for another donation to the magic fridge to replenish the alcohol arthur henrick california i love listening to this podcast but the last several podcasts haven t gotten to me on time because of data usage issues so many people are trying to get this podcast that the allotted bandwidth is being eceeded 30 episodes love love love the podcast first heard it on xm radio several years ago and got hooked keep up the great work just gets better and better great podcast like geeking out with my friends slice is one of my go to podcasts excellent production values witty banter and good solid geek cred among the host make this one of my favorites joe bob says check it out best podcast i have ever listened to out of 80 they even play your voicemails on the feedback show written with an ipod touch curse you itunes app keyboard the regular news edition covers all the happenings in tv and movies with the strong opinions that geeks love share and still truly entertain the non geeks the interviews are fun and enlightening while very fan boy ish they still ask the tough questions but the voicemail show is even better this wild collection of feedback smack talk jokes and some amazing listener produced comedy bits really is worth the time there is a community behind this show and the quality of the feedback reflects the variety and strength of the listeners i subscribe to many podcasts but to tell the truth this is one of the few that i listen to every week every week they seem to have the most interesting guests the funniest comments and the other news is just great do yourself a favore and listen great interviews honest reviews engaging cast what else do you want in a weekly podcast to be sure most of the time the get it right and agree with my opinions but even when they are wrong the tell everyone the way it is not a podcast to go without great job guys i love the mix of news and reviews on this podcast all relating to science fiction on tv or in the movies plus they get some great interviews the worst part is they just keep adding to my to watch list i love you guys the show and everything you do keep it up for all of us geeks out there this podcast is for you all i laugh every week twice a week with the voicemail show this podcast is all about sci fi as well as real science they have great interviews that will keep you informed about or learn about all the sci fi you can handle not to mention the multiverse news it is all in all a great show to subscribe to i have tried many podcasts and many podcasts have come and gone these are the only guys i have been listening to consistently since 2006 try them out i love this podcast if i ever have to restore my iphone it wil be the first thing i add love this show as they rant and have a great time the information is good and the interviews are really amazing some of the inteviews could really be longer as well but hey they only have so much time this long runing podcast is for dedicated fans of science fiction tv and movies they cover other media as well but the core focus is tv and film the production values are solid the hosts are funny intelligent and steeped in sf past and present and they are their own people they don t watch all the same shows or love the same shows this gives listeners a more honest view of what s out there as well as a broader view of the industry as between them they see just about everything that comes out best of all for me are the interviews with actors writers directors producers etc from current and upcoming shows and movies most of the time the guest is not the lead actor and i m going to say that this is a choice the show makes i like that choice it adds another dimension to what i know about the shows i watch give this podcast a try it s worth your time and you will enjoy it i used to love listening to this show now it has become a whine fest where the only thing the hosts do is complain about everything this one of the few podcasts that consistantly amuses and informs me the voicemail is a bright spot to my week and i find the crew hilarious while i don t always agree with their opinions i enjoy and respect their views although one of the better science fiction fantasy speculative podcasts out there i feel as if the show has lost some of its charm ever since summer stopped appearing regularly instead the show kind of went off the rails a bit with a wingin it like mentality without summer to rein in the others the show tends to dwell too much on jokes and rants i prefer a show that s a bit more thoughtful in its commentary don t get me wrong the show is still entertaining with its interviews and the friendly banter and the slice of trivia to keep things interesting but it s no longer a show that i anticipate listening to each week as for the voice mail show the less said the better i ll only said that if i want to listen to a user submitted variety show i wouldn t i d read a book instead i was hoping for more thoughtful dialogue and feedback from the cast love it my favorite podcast voicemail show rocks from matt babbling brothers the geek show this show offers everything related to sci fi news reviews speculation and discussion all mixed in with funny commentary the voicemail show is also made of fabulous except for 211 because as the voicemails play the hosts add their own viewpoints and often mockery i like having one podcast that i can listen to so that i can keep up with the scifi world and slice of scifi is that podcast consistently good articles guest interviews and commentary make it one podcast that i have to listen to each week i have only been listening for about 6 months and i am loving every episode i especially love the voice mail shows are you stuck in an office with people who don t know the difference between star trek star wars and star gate it s ok put these tiny people in your ipod and the soothing knowlegable voices will inform you entertain you and make you wanna be part of it all come to the party i ve been a fan for about a year and look forward every week to their next podcast love their humor trivia reviews if i lived near them these would be drinking buddies for sure listen you ll like it i tried to listen to a recent episodes the episode literally started with a commerical for a software product following by introductions followed by vague references for a contest on their website followed by a plug for a different podcast followed by a commerical for this other podcast finally over 6 minutes into the episode they lead off with a real astronaut factoid not much sfici they make it very difficult for a new listener to become a fan be forewarned do not participate in their forums if you re an advocate of free speech if they do not agree with you they ll endorse calling you inappropriate names and then ban you when you defend yourself especially if the show s sugardaddy gets wind of your politics i absolutely love this show and love the connections these folks have and the depth of knowledge they bring to the science fiction universe especially loved the interview with john noble hertzog from the dining at the end of the universe podcast really enjoy this show makes my day at work go much faster topics are great news is interesting keep up the good work not very enlightening or well researched it s basically a full hour of complaining about things sight unseen it s more entertaining for all of the wrong reasons a great show with terrific hosts slice of scifi is not one to be looked over this show has amazing staying power with over 200 episodes at the time of this review their episodes aren t always the same either with a mix of voice mail shows interviews and the regular discussion episodes this is truly the ultimate in scifi podcasts i first started listening to this show back when i was twelve and just getting into sci fi i am 14 now and i am into chuck bab 5 all kinds of books and movies it s all because of these guys that keep you informed entertained and the news is the best out there there is always something new and exciting going on in the shows first thing we listen to hear at home along with their other shows voices of babylon dargon page and with class all are done by the same people and all are just as well done give it a listen you will be glad you did darcy low this is an excellent podcast one of my favorites to listen to they are obviously passionate about what they talk about and they have a lot of fun doing it it reminds me of how i sit around with my friends and talk about stuff that i like i don t think i could keep up with the myriad sci fi projects out there without the help of this show i look forward to it and will miss it over the holidays actually to say this is just a sci fi podcast does the show a disservice the hosts cover a wide range of entertainment and do it intelligently i couldn t get by without this show on my ipod this is a must hear podcast i download every sunday and on the way to work school the kids and i listen every monday it is always entertaining and often informative my daughter who is not a geek enjoys listening and has been able to impress boys with her knowledge of things scifi good job team wow what can say u guys rock love this podcast if you love scifi then you must give these guys gal a listen the website the production quality and the preperation for each show comes through on this podcast if you are a scifi fan let this replace one of the others you are subscribed to i have had to pull over some times or i will wreck my truck these people are the funniest thing out there love it i love this show the interviews and news items used to be enough then came the joust and frogger now i listen to the voicemail shows more than the actual shows absolutely a show i can not do without it s aural crack for the scifi geek i have found out more diverse items of interest from this crew than from any other cast i ve listened to and i listen to a lot yes they are opinionated and that s the fun of it much like discussing scifi stuff with my friends over a few beers if i could get enough of them together to do just that i have been turned on to books movies and way too much tv by these pushers and i love it if you are looking for a show with a bit of everything that has a website and forum that expands on that everything in a huge way this is the podcast for you oh and there are swag contests too i love this show you will too when i started listening a few years ago it was mike and evo and a few months back evo mysteriously vanished without a comment the humor isn t quite the same as it was before but it still is a solid podcast show i wish they could have at least said goodbye to evo instead of cutting him out instantly with no explanation to the fans this is the first podcast that i d ever listened to and i m still listening the show is always good and informative the crew keeps the topics fresh and they always interview my favortie people smoochies cat this podcast is one of the few i actually listen to they provide great information on upcoming sci fi projects and insight into current projects in tv and movies it s entertaining and i m so glad they put this on itunes exelent podcast but i was wondering if there is a super feed where i can get all of micael and evo s podcasts their just so good i don t like all these different feeds i love this show but and isn t there always a but i wish these guys were a little more well rounded on their knowledge of scifi even with summer and joe they don t seem to get more than 45 of their faqs correct but i do like the show and think they do a great job entertaining me on my 2 5 hour commute is mike actually drunk on every show he sure sounds drunk this is micheal and evo s slice of sci fi and it lives up to its name i look forward to listening to the show every tuesday its full of news entertainment and please note opinions its also great that they have a voicemail line where you can talk about what you like or your difference of opinion or the matrix trilogy heh michael and evo s slice of sci fi is the best source of sci fi news and fun that i ve ever seen their shows are of very high quality and entertainment value each week they discuss news in movie and tv sci fi from coming releases to some of your favorites currently on the air they even delve into the near future and bring you news about scifi like things that may be scifact in the months or a couple of years to come on top of all this mike and evo hold interviews nearly every week some of the people they ve interviewed include jamie bamber chase masterson rod roddenberry bruce campbell walter keonig peter mayhew richard hatch and many others from all over the sci fi world these guys are very good at what they do their show is fun informative and entertaining do they have their opinions obviously we all do do they share their opinions of course this is their show after all the good the bad and the ugly if it s sci fi you ll hear it here on michael and evo s slice of sci fi for what it s worth the show is a relaxed and often entertaining diversion for fans of sci fi tv movies presented by fans of the genre heavily opinionated as most fan run shows are but the hosts are at their best when conducting interviews allowing the guest enough time to speak while still moving things along some concerns about show prep because all the hosts don t seem to be caught up on the different programs being discussed i think this stifles the freewheeling nature of the discussion production values at the level of good student run college radio between 3 and 4 stars in my book worth a download for fans of popular sci fi i want to like this show but ugh every time they start to get interesting evo takes over and kills it dont mention buffy evos never seen it so dont mention it dont mention x y or z evo hasnt seen it hates it or is planning to watch it someday and doesnt want to hear spoilers so dont mention it i dont know its just not there you know it just seems to me that this is a science fiction podcast run by people who dont even like sci fi case in point they constantly refer to scifi channel as skiffy and then talk about how much they hate the channel its like nails on a chalkboard at times other than bsg stargate and firefly they seem to hate everything i just dont get it oh except for the show surface which they loved to trash until they got some interviews with the cast now they suddenly love it go figure there are some interesting and enjoyable characters on the show td the stormtrooper for one but for the most part i just dont get it there are much better podcasts out there on the other hand its free so what the heck download it and decide for yourself there is actually some good stuff here but i just ugh oh well decide for yourself i guess thats what a 3 star rating means excellent quality weekly podcast the show covers everything a scifi fan needs to know news rumors and occasional review the show moves along quite well with excellent production skills nan,64,4.359375

about the world  great book recommendations i enjoyed listening to the interview with margaret drabble and will listen to others  thoughtful interview questions  thank you  but really hard on my budget  i binged on 9 episodes in one day and then bought large quantities of books that had been recommended  listening to this podcast is such a delightful way to spend the afternoon  i love the

februarys podcast which i hadnt yet gotten to   i was haviang such a good time on my long drive that i relistened all the way back to november  i love that they are not all about the most current

1494476041,Slime & EXTRAordinary Jobs with Nichole Jacklyne,Entrepreneurship,Nichole Jacklyne,1494476041,30,63636,best podcast ever love this pod jdnhd s downs sksks s jacklyne i wish i could met her hi nicole could you talk about how to deal with hate uncoordn poop to nichole jacklyne nichole jacklyne unorganized talks in circles absolutely love this podcast i love them love this so much love u love it you need to list love this pls read this thank you so much love this podcast this podcast is inspiration and a must watch for everyone who wants to succeed in life she talks a lot but says nothing  hello i am nine years old and this my most favorite podcastslime is my favorite thing and my slime journey began on july 14 2020 i was playing with slime while writing a review my favorite slime is butter slime love this podcast this podcast is absolutely amazing and so inspiring as well as informative you are so awesome luv you  i love her she live in my state  cant wait for what happens i love her shes so cool and i inspire to be her when i grow older thanks i like but did not show slime i love you nichole jacklyne  i watch nicholes youtube and the second i watched her on youtube i knew that i was gonna love her and her channel  i was so excited to listen to her podcast  i love her so much she is so inspiring to me   the people who are giving this podcast high ratings are surely her young fans who love nichole  not people who are listening for actual advice  the episodes lack structure and aim because nichole fails to build a logical discussion ultimately no main ideas supported by strong clear supporting points  over and over she will make a point or give advice then eventually say the exact opposite  her overuse of the words literally honestly and truly is nauseating  unfortunately it becomes clear that she has little understanding about business  her hype was built on a trend that is steadily in decline  the real test will be getting her business to a stable maintainable place  overall youll come away with lots of pedestrian recommendations like dont give up on your goals learn from your mistakes dont let others get you down etc   and thats about it  its difficult to see how she can continue with more episodes because those that exist mostly just repeat the same stuff nichole would benefit from some episode planning utilizing outlines to follow as well as focus on vocabulary and logic  ive followed nichole jacklyne on youtube for a long while but i started listening to her a short time ago and iove this podcast i look forward to it every week i love them so much  i look forward to them every week  thank you so much for your vids and your podcast ive subscribed to you channel and podcast  i love you can you give me a shot out and am 9 this is amazing i love it ive been listening to this all day love it ive probably been a subscriber for 2 years and ive loved all your content you were actually my inspiration to start my slime shop tropical slimez and im sosososo exited about this podcast it rly helps me out in starting my business im only 11 and i just wanted to say that i love you and ur channel soooo much so keep posting and stay happy hey nicole jacklyne i am a fellow slime lover i have a podcast about slime too its called super slimez and i talk about all things slime i have been watching your videos for a super long time i was wondering if you could give me feedback on the podcast i would love to feature you on the show i use anchor to so you can send me a voice message please respond through anchor that would amazing thank you for your time hi im so happy you doing this i hope youre having fun i love your videos on youtube to so ty for doing thislove slime by nichole jacklyne i love her and i am a youtube my self so i know how busy it is  i like to listen to it when i am bored and it makes me smile i just recently discovered nichole channel and i am so glad i did because it really helps me understand what is like to be a successful businesswoman and youtuber  also listening to this podcast nichole helps and educates everyone on slime but also you get to understand more about working in a niche industry  success doesnt happen overnight  my single mom is self employed and most people dont understand how hard it can be financial physical and mental especially taking care of two children  i could definitely see how hard nichole works and she never gives up even if she reach stability you always must keep planning ahead  nichole you are a truly inspiration and i believe everyone should listen to this podcast and watch your youtube channel  sincerely thomas r if you are a fan of this person then this podcast is for you  otherwise there is really nothing of value in this podcast  what i can glean from sufferi ahem listening to two full eps is that this woman really has no clue about business  she seems to speak as if she has a secret you all need to learn when in reality she talks in circles about things that clearly show luck has played a huge part in her career at all  i want to listen to podcasts from knowledgeable people not the advice to try your best and be yourself  this was super interesting and i enjoyed listening to this when i was bored  hello nan,23,4.47826087

austin have the uncanny ability to make my dog fall immediately asleep  i went back to the first episode and listened to all of them in order  great show guys these guys are great motorsports podcasts

1315040130,Slow Burn,History,Slate Podcasts,1315040130,48,108804,great reporting great team no pesca no slate outstanding enjoyable listen liberal brainwashed propaganda great journalism david duke history we need just another liberal didnt finish wonderful  same playbook dogs need  history repeats itself lazy and tired narrative slow adheavy fantastic listen fake news bag of donuts is a bot really enjoyed all 4 seasons fake news blackout the duke saga excellent  hahahahaha a great and informative listen revelatory storytelling another trump hater to know duke is to understand trump engaging listening yes to all seasons  first 2 seasons are great im not shtting myself love this podcast was very good has faltered nicely done the duke podcast flops    disturbing and yet i cant turn away love the content not the narration if youre a podcast advertiser please read this updated whoa cool excellent as always story telling at its best season 1 and season 4 host is maddening excellent reporting podcast went downhill was great and then           one of my favorite podcasts every season original excellent slow burn this is what i look for in journalism  very well done and respectable   started with david duke one quite a cold foreshadowing of our current affairs    f those guys and the milk rainbow they rode in on  thankfully off deleted until mike returned im so disappointed to see reviewers referencing this as political liberal or antitrump  telling the story about an openly racist nazi who cloaks his racism in religion and supposed christianity is providing a service to america  if you view this criticism as any of those titles listed above perhaps this hits a bit too close to home for you  this guy came dangerously close to becoming the  governor of a very racially divided state  the damage he could have done to the psyche of minorities in that state could have taken generations to mend  ill let the listener decide if they hear similarities between the strategies between duke and trump as well as the fervent supporters of each of them  enjoy the work  produced very well  compelling wellexplained storyline  fascinating parallels with current events  this terrible podcast was only created to expose trumps racism  i was extremely offended  i wanted to listen to something nice and fuzzy but when they described the nazis actions he sounded a lot like trump and i realized that ive been following an idiot  i am not okay with this  if you like me wish to live in ignorance stay away from this podcast  excellent podcast  the only negative reviews are from trumpies who are mad he lost i just finished the last episode on david duke   i went to lsu with duke and later worked on the antiduke campaign when he ran for the senate and later for governor of louisiana   the reporting was exceptional and it was great to hear so many familiar voices looking back on it 30 years later the parallels to trump are undeniable   even if you know nothing about david duke i think you will find this story well worth a listen  thank you  5 min in and i learn he started his story on watergate because it was made during the debunked trumprussia crap  so just another liberal pretending to want to share something cool just to have an opportunity to attack trump  its old and tiring  i just wanted a good story but this guy wants to put in his jabs about modern politicsmake sure we know his clear bias so yeah   im good  im not even a fan of trump  what im a fan of is people taking time to write creative material instead of just going for the laugh less low hanging fruit that is trump  great narrator great music makes topics that i thought i knew all about seem very new and  intriguing  really keeps you interested  very well done more please just like joe biden and his resistance to racial jungles  same playbook as trump and the gop i love this podcast i love the host of this podcast because i feel like hes a great narrator and he sticks with facts  i never sense his personal opinion  thats the best part i have no idea how he feels and i am thrilled  i just want factual information and stories  i dont want the hosts feelings involved  thanks boy some things just dont change    listening to this just makes me keep thinking of our current political atmosphere  liberals trying to link trump supports and duke supporters is just a lazy and tired narrative  i loved the first three seasons but i will be unsubscribing going forward  started listening to tupacbiggie season so missed out on watergate and lewinsky  these are 30 minute episodes with 4 ad breaks there are some podcasts that are 4 hours long looking at you hardcore history with no breaks  many podcasts have ads at the beginning  not a fan of this slowdrip adheavy format that takes you out the story  binge worthy not an actual review but i saw a review from  fake news bag of donuts that is laughably bad so i was compelled    looking forward to seeing whats selected for season 5  well well well  we now have a phone call of biden threatening the president of ukraine to cover up investigations right after trump got elected    biden threatening financially as well as physically  in his own words   this was two weeks after trump got elected   oann  wont hear the actual clip on any lib media  a story of a smart man wanting to be somebody and willing to use subterfuge exaggerations and racial n cultural biases to achieve his goals  fascinating and well researched expos  david dukes story is a parable of lament aimed in the wrong direction  spectacular research extremely welledited  i love the perspective of lesserknown players in the scandal  hahahahaha ive loved every season  any trump supporters in denial that they are exactly the same types of fascists who supported david duke clearly have little capacity for critical thought but i guess that was obvious  this show helps dissect the question how did we get here in american politics  preluding the trumpian world we are living today with insight and historical background that just makes your jaw drop  bravo to the team  trying to align trump voters with duke voters  this was so enlightening to me after learning about duke made me understand trump  the people that support him  there will always be racist politicians unfortunately  season 4 focuses on david duke and his bid for governor of louisiana in 1992  his opponent was one of the most despised men in louisiana politics so known as a crook that he gave out bumper stickers that said vote for the crook  its an engaging look at a crucial moment in american history and race relations  the question resonates now more than everwould i vote my conscience for a candidate i despise if it meant defeating a truly evil opponent one reviewer said that seasons three and four fell short for them  ive listened to all four seasons now  theyre all   the subject of season 3 could perhaps be considered more esoteric due 1 to the length of time thats passed since the deaths of tupac and biggie and 2 the narrower angle on a part of the overall american culture because of the genre of music they represent  the work that went into production and research and coverage is a plus  as someone who was a young adult at that time and aware of only the deaths and none of the backstory i was fascinated and drawn into each episode  ive been a public school educator since 1993 mostly middle and high school and the deaths of tupac and biggie were seismic and the reverberations continue  the intrigue and mystery and desire for things to have turned out differently has continued through at least one generation  tupac and biggie are still remembered idolized and romanticized this season reviews the background and history of the beef including the opposition to socalled gangster rap  this is a part of our american culture and history and besides its importance i personally found it compelling and exceedingly welldone  season 4 i saw david duke and thought umm no thanks  not even sure why i listened but yep it was worth it too  fascinating to compare the culture weve been living in since 2016 and to trace it back to its predecessor  seasons 3 and 4 may not immediately appeal to someone due to the seemingly esoteric nature of one and the toocloseforcomfort of the other both were superb and that is not a word i use lightly  its the only superlative ive got though  the bonus interview for episode 5 of season 3 really makes me feel the need to show real money  appreciation to slate with a subscription  seasons 3 and 4 really fell flat for me  i love this podcast i really do can you please stop airing these stupid ads talking about how im shtting myself yes we both know theyre really saying shoulding we also both know that the reason theyre saying it is because it totally sounds just like shtting its offensive and its stupid  love this podcast i loved listening and learning through each of the seasons   watergate predates me so that was mostly new info   i was a teen during clinton so that was a lot more detail than i was aware of   the only thing that keeps bumping me is the parallels leon keeps drawing to trump  i get that he hates him but it seems amateurish when perpetual investigations continue to turn up no evidence   hollow comparison update 81220  just finished the latest season focused on david dukes gubernatorial run in 1991   pretty fascinating topic as i knew almost nothing about him   his past statements on race speak pretty clearly on what kind of person he is so it was strange to listen to the host deliver the show in a bizarrely personal partisan way   it was very amateurishly done and very unbalanced by not having either duke himself or any supporters of his featured in any episodes   lots of references to his racism through his words but no examples given during the times he was in positions of leadership   the statement in episode 3 or 4 stating that the host made the decision not to feature duke was the tipping point in this season for me   very childlike approach to reportage   very poor execution of what should have been an otherwise intriguing topic for this seasons performance ive reduced my score by one  great podcast  very informative and captivating i never want to leave until the episode closes  great job the david duke story is perfect pod cast material  but this one like almost every duke story just totally misses the point   yeah we get it hes a racist bigot narcissistic  ahole   but thats not the whole story  heck the world has plenty of those the rise of duke and the people who voted for him  cannot be just brushed aside   delve into the feelings of his supporters dont just label them as dumb ass rednecks  blanket statements such as    duke supporters felt like the white race was being treated unfairly  which is so laughable absurd     only dismiss them as ignorant and uneducated    if you want to be a journalist ask  why did they feel that way instead of dismissing them outright  maybe they have a point or maybe they are 100 wrong  but it deserves discussion also multiple times during this podcast statements are made that are categorically untrue such as  recently there has been a massive  number of terrorist attacks by white supremists     you dont have to make such statements to condemn racism but try to be somewhat factual race and racism is a excellent topic for indepth discussion  but a 8 hour diatribe on duke is a  racist and duke supporters were racist rednecksmisses the point this is not journalism  this is same old crap weve been hearing for 30 years thumbs down  i rate a story based upon how well the common narrative is weaved in with whats necessary and needed in its retelling for todays audience  with nixon clinton and david duke who was more fascinating in a stomachchurning kind of way that i could have ever imagined this is accomplished with great detail  i really hate to write this because it sounds so petty but i have always struggled to listen to this podcast because the narration is very unnatural robotic  its just difficult for me to focus and listen to  its not like serial or other podcasts where i feel the narration is engaging and captivating  i want to listen to it because i love the content and the storylines  its just difficult to get through  updated review bumped up to 5 stars  advertising is way more tolerable this season david duke  thank you for listening to your subscribers old review is there a story in this podcastwho knows because all i hear are advertisements  i understand that you want people to subscribe to your paid service but this is the most toxic way to do it if youre a marketer know that your product ad will only be heard on shows with limited ad breaks  when our ears are barraged with this many commercials we listeners skip huge blocks of advertisements on shows like this or we abandon the shows all together  additionally us listeners begin to resent your company for the constant interruptions this current model does not work  im abandoning this show after 3 episodes of season 3 because its unbearable  i can tell theres good journalism and a good story happening but i dont care anymore  fix your advertising system  is your next story going to be about how n y  teen tawana brawley was late coming home so instead of angering her parents she claimed three white men raped her  kidnapped her causing al sharpton to come to town turning the summer of 87 into near full blown race riots just a thought  ya see guys like david duke are born out of race baiting hysterics  youre giving trump the election by erasing bad democrat history because those who choose selectively shove the past under a rock are guaranteed to repeat it the 2020 trump election will look like the floor of a slaughter house thanks to the way the new left chooses to shame people into vote  leftys like you have destroyed our democratic party timely and disturbing  so whats next please please please do iran contra i go on long walks with my pups and i need you to give me more episodes on any topic pronto  one of the best podcasts out there  thank you ive listened to season 4 on david duke and season 1 about watergate  both were very interesting and its impossible to not draw parallels to our current political situation in 2020 he begins each sentence in a high pitch and then trails off into a lower register  every sentence  drives me to distraction  why not simply tell the story in ones own voiceotherwise excellent  ive learned a lot from every season  the episodes are informative and well made seasons one and two were amazing  season three was full of factual errors and was clearly reported on by someone who has no idea about hiphop culture  season four was a mj obvious way to try to tie david dukes ideology to donald trump subtle jabs are prominent throughout the series even though david duke endorsed democrat candidate tulsi gabbard  journalism is dead unfortunately  really enjoyed it until he virtue signals his way out of the duke interview  if you choose not to interview him thats fine  but you dont have to lecture people on why it would immoral to interview him because hes bad  youre a reporter not my mother  well produced and excellent hosts  the first two seasons are really extraordinary podcasts series  seasons 3 and 4 are not quite as compelling as the earlier seasons  however they are still top quality podcast seasons  highly recommend  i have thoroughly enjoyed every season of slow burn  if you are new to this podcast start at the beginning  every topic covered has resonance in life today  i am currently listening to the david duke season with a sinking recognition to each episode  well done  extremely well done and topical  nan,50,3.86

finally i found real russian classes appropriate subjects for anyone to gain russian competence fantastic podcast excellent russian language learning resource very professional podcast excellent excellent podcast this is amazing ideal   very clear very helpful excellent podcast series daria is the teacher who makes you want to come to class when textbooks are not enough     great for early intermediate learners great series wonderful   save yourself a couple of years by learning here    a very helpful podcast my parents are native russians but i was born here and never became fluent  this is one of the best ways for me to get back into russian  im listening to this podcast alongside learning russian with babbel  and i love it even if youre a super beginner its great to listen to daria and her mom speak  daria explains the context of the vocabulary and interesting phrases in a really illuminating way and the subject matter is always engaging  she also provides transcripts for the eps so you can follow along  ill definitely be listening to all of them thank you so much daria i wanted to learn russian and outside of the books and lessons listening to the podcast and the information really help  you do an amazing job explains the vocabulary and culture and i feel like i learn some important things every time i listen  i cant wait for the next update and stay safe                     youtube        she does a great job teaching and explaining  what a great resource you are  ive been looking for practice in listening and making conversation  keep up the great work i love this podcast  even as a complete beginner learner of russian this has helped me to understand russian speaking concepts and pick up more vocabulary  she is excellent at providing examples and teaching how to talk in russian as a natural speaker rather than just textbook  highly recommend amazing the things youll find when youre curious at 3am  never did i expect to stumble upon such an invaluable resource this is taking me to the next level thanks so much one of the most entertaining and helpful language learning podcasts i know of                  i studied russian in college over 40 years ago  i lived in the ussr  in 1979 and have spoken with russians off and in since that time  i got very rusty   dariyas podcast is the perfect refresher   i especially like the tips on how conversational russian differs from the formal written language              i have been studying russian for a few years textbook style  after discovering darias website and this podcast my russian has moved from textbook beginner to a more natural conversationalist  the learning is less rigorous and more fun  keep it up i studied russian 40 years ago in college and am reviewing it now that im participating in a watercolor workshop that will be conducted in that language  darias podcast has been most valuable in my study and review  not only is she knowledgeable on how to go about teaching russian but she makes it interesting and informative  plus her voice is pleasant and pleasing to the ears  great job daria ive tried countless number of russian audiobooks and podcasts  almost all of them are too basic and boring  darias podcast is amazing  her insights and lessons are like a private behind the scenes tour of the real russian language and culture  best of all her slow precise pronunciation of russian words is incredibly valuable in building my own speaking habits  daria is the best she has a very pleasant voice to listen to and puts an enormous amount of time and effort into each lesson  everything is read slowly and articulated clearly  enunciation of each letter of this phonetic language is easy to discern  show notes are also written in both russian and english so after listening you can go back and read recite repeat or look up anything you may need further practice on  her grasp and command of the english language is amazing which makes it possible for her to explain grammar and vocabulary in great detail with lots of examples to make the meaning of the russian text understandable  she gets the subtle nuances of both languages and uses slang idioms and phrasing that is both interesting and entertaining  on top of all that lessons are very informative  i never really knew anything about russian history or culture before listening to her podcasts  i am so glad she decided to start doing these again      thank you for the amazing podcast daria all of your podcast material and subject matter are outstanding  anyone looking to learn or improve their language abilities will definitely benefit from darias courses podcasts and lesson structure  i have learned so much through the years and really appreciate all the energy you must put into this work im glad youre making episodes again  i really love your podcast daria  please i have moved to russia dont know swears please help this helped me learn some great expressions and new vocabulary to use while conversing in russian   wish it was continuing  could not recommend more  thanks im studying russian and i really enjoy this podcast  im not a passive learner i copy texts i listen and repeat i read and i try to watch authentic content online  darias podcasts and videos are amazing and theyve helped me grow  i like learning russian and i like the content here  this is a highly recommend podcast for someone interested in just diving right into their studies  thanks so much for making this podcast  it is very helpful dariathank you for the explanation   it is very meaningful and gives great insight into the psyche of russian speaking peoples   thank you    i love darias approach in these podcasts its always something interesting this is the perfect podcast for listening while driving   great job daria thank you so much  my wife is russian and we have 2 young kids  i would love for her to teach me russian but the little time we have together is spent doing other things  your podcast is very helpful as im going down the path of learning russian through podcasts apps and books  not the best method although she shares interesting facts about russia    daria knows her stuff   i started studying russian in college and find this podcast targets subjects that captured my early love of the language   noticed what a difference having a great teacher makes in helping move along the learning process   daria is the real deal   went to russia im 1993 then again in 2006 and going again in july so i appreciate darias podcast for reigniting my interest and diffusing some negative perceptions regarding russia   i still love this language thanks to great teachers and friends  keep them coming lessons teach russian language through music poetry history and modern culture  texts are  read in slow russian with sentence by sentence translation  i really love all different podcasts that daria does  they have different formats to satisfy any listener and she improves them all the time based on the feedback from listeners  you could hear all the love put into making these podcasts  i have learned so much about history and culture for russia what is very valuable  i do recommend to buy the 600 phrase book as well because it is excellent to know the real russian language and not the text book russian  excellent podcast and host highly recommended to all great for all levels   very helpful for those who are transitioning from beginner to intermediate as this develops fluency and builds an understanding of the language and the culture   for more advanced students this series fills in gaps and clarifies   daria is not only informative but entertaining as well   i wish we had this when i was in college i found  this podcast accidentally and it is the single most helpful resource ive had since i had a real russian teacher   i have listened to over half of her episodes so far and have most of them saved to go over again later  sometimes i put it on while im at work even though im hardly listening and other times i sit taking notes while i listen  either way its of great help and i urge anyone to subscribe  im what i like to call an intermediate novice so i usually cant translate a full sentence but can pick out a fair amount of words  you can tell so much thought and time goes into each episode daria has a lovely voice great taste and insight  her podcasts are entertaining charming and interesting   she understands exactly what booklearned people need to develop listening and speaking confidence and fluency                                                  excellent for practicing and improving your russian language skills  this podcast is easy to listen to and follow for a beginning learner like me   the culture helps lessons stick   i enjoy listening   i aprticularly liked the current goldilocks episodenext year in august i am riding from odessa to st  petersburg   this podcast is part of my prep for the trip listening to the current episode reminds me the podcast includes a lot of current culture info   very helpful that way also  i must say that this is the best series of podcasts ive found so far for learning russian  each russian segment is broken down into digestible fragments and explained in detail   additionally all of them are available on the authors website along with the text transcript and translation   just fabulous  thanks so much for creating this podcast series this podcast is not for beginners  but if you have a couple of years of study or if you studied previously and would like something to help keep in practice it is hard to find a more useful podcast  daria creates lessons that combine not only vocabulary and grammar but also aspects of culture and daily russian life which are fun and fascinating  she does it all with a voice that comes across as clear confident and slightly sultry as if you are having a private language  lesson over a cup of coffee or maybe shots of vodka  along with the texts she provides and the videos on youtube there is enough material to keep an intermediate russian student or casual russophile learning in a way that is fun or at least painless        these are everyday prose conversations warts and all recorded using normal voices and cadences and subsequently parsed slowly repeated and thoroughly explained by daria in her naturally relaxed and soothing and informative and somewhat playful style  if you find that your textbooks are failing to help you to understand real life conversations then this podcast will be immensely helpful to you   this podcast and associated websitevideos are perfect for someone who is past the beginner stage and looking for good intermediate level practice  this is not easy to find most sites are way too simple or go straight to advanced russian  the instructor provides very clear explanation and a ton of practical examples of new vocabulary and phrases  podcast is super fun to listen to in the car  this is an enjoyable way to brush up on your russian and learn more  daria is fresh and informative  fun to listen to even if its a bit beyond my level of comprehension  i look forward to revisiting episodes as my knowledge increases  also i have a feeling daria has no idea how funny she is  great stuff  fantastic podcast listening to daria explain grammatical concepts figures of speech and russian cultural quirks feels more like listening to a russian friend than a language learning tool  i am a professional interpreter adding russian as a new working language and i listen to this podcast every day to get a good handle on things before moving onto an advanced level    i have had so much russian grammar but dont undertand when it is spoken to me   thank you for speaking russian to us slowly   i hope this avenue of learning russian will make me conversational  darias language teaching techniques and the stories she uses throughout her podcasts and other course material is very interesting and informative  daria provides language learning education as well as cultural insight that just cant be found in other courses  daria also specializes in tprs language learning which is one of the most proficient methods of learning new language  i would highly recommend darias podcast if anyone wants to expand their knowledge of the russian language and or culture  great podcast the only thing i wish is that there were more   i really find the content of the podcast interesting and its helping me pick up on the cadence and pronunciation of the language even at my amateur beginner level  nan,50,4.88

of cinematic history you ll find on itunes this podcast is educational funny and wonderfully indulgent i m a huge film nerd and i absolutely love it there s is so much really quality information in every episode and i really feel like i m learning every time i listen thank you tom and slate for all your hard work so many podcasts are full of so much filler and this one can barely pack in all of the information it delivers what a great podcast if you re intrerested in the topics i think you ll really enjoy listening not annoying to listen to at all as with many home produced podcasts these guys are serious about their mission and it translates to the product thanks tom and slate one of the very best film buff podcasts the hosts take turns picking a topic and giving a report to the other on how said topic is dealt with in movies every episode is enjoyable and the hosts explore their subjects without incessant blathering or going down tangential rabbit holes i have found most podcasts that discuss film to be unbearable because the on mic personalities are obnoxious and ignorant dude bros who open their shows with painfully abrasive theme music the slums of film history along with the projection booth goes on my short list of shows that actually have smart people discussing film a good series which discusses some of the trends in film that hollywood doesn t discuss at the academy awards but you figure is discussed between producers and studio heads it s actually entertaining and thought provoking time well spent toxic waste in season 2 is great there is so much knowledge about things you don t really think about in movies some of it makes me laugh out loud if you are a film buff take a listen these guys are great the amount of research they do for each episode is awesome one of my favorite podcasts exploring the twisted and explicit realms of film when i need to listen to something witty that gets my brain interested and keeps me awake this podcast is it it never ceases to amaze me what these guys come up with give it a try you won t be disappointed absolutely love these two so glad to have them in my cinema based rotation my only complaint is there aren t enough episodes to binge yet seriously guys love your show your humor is right in line with both my husband s and mine thank you for your hard work please keep it up bumfights early days but i love where these guys are going with this series who would have thought you could draw a line between such seemingly disparate subjects as charlie chaplin and toxic goop great sound design adds to the ambience a friend shared this with me and i was instantly interested because of the topics caught my eye cannibalism naked people film history sold also the hosts are genuinely seem to be having fun and seem to have done their research i ll be tuning in every week super intelligent and insightful i ve learned so much from this podcast can t wait to keep listening i listen to a lot of podcasts and i can honestly say that this one is great it s super entertaining and also educational and kinda gross a everything you ve always wondered about film but were too polite to talk about an absolutely fantastic thoroughly interesting and completely enjoyable way to spend some time you won t be disappointed from hollywood to hornywood these guys tackle the topics that you can t bring up in polite society they combine wit with solid research to produce a show that simultaneously educates and disgusts and it s perfect if you re a fan of film listen to this podcast i actually had to shut the fist episode off because they were getting really in depth about eating brains and it was early in the morning and i kinda started to feel like i might lose my breakfast but i decided to come back for more because they are really funny guys the show is well produced and you can tell that they are really knowledgeable on their topics even if you aren t super into film you will still find this podcast entertaining this show has quickly become a favorite in my diverse podcast arsenal it s all the information i never needed or wanted to know about film but now can t live without listening to these guys is like hanging out with your close friends they have the balls to discuss things we all really want to know about film naked chicks gore and uncontrollably bowel movements you won t want your mom knowing you listen to this podcast and that s what makes it awesome having had a little time to reflect on past events i think i ve finally begun to understand better that certain taboos are just not acceptable in polite society the topics in this podcast manage to appeal to my deviant nature while maintaining that delicate balance between low brow and criminal i must admit that i am particularly intrigued and excited by the upcoming installment on gross babies keep up the good work slate and tom jared f 0093578 even as someone with a moderate interest in film history slums of film history is extremely entertaining slate and tom are really funny and i leave each episode with tons of anecdotal factoids highly recommended to anyone with two ears and a commute a friend sent me this podcast and it s my favorite thing ever now i looked at the upcoming topics on the website and can t wait to hear the history of nudity episodes 5 stars i listen on my commute to and from work and love the discussions and the humor especially some of the side comments i ve learned all kinds of fun facts about films that i never would have know before and i want to hear more keep them coming great job i m honestly not that into movies and certainly not trashy movies but this podcast has me anxiously awaiting each wednesday s new episode i go to the gym for an hour just to listen and definitely get some funny looks while i m breathlessly laughing on the elliptical about blood butts and other generally inappropriate stuff seriously though these guys make fascinating connections illustrating how trashy movies are truely a sign of their times great new find can t wait for more excellent new podcast slums of film history is well produced with interesting and informed content right out of the box i ll have another serving of the brains please nan,41,5

describe the episode about nonoffending pedophiles than an attempt at not only normalizing it but declaring it a sexuality in the same regard as heterosexuality  misinformation and sheer ignorance of this form is dangerous  it harms everyone in a society  if you listened to that episode and had no issues with the way information was presented you may want to seek professional counseling and therapy there are no words to describe how disgusting the women are who created this podcast and thought this was appropriate to publish and post im always shocked an amazed that people like this roam free even more so to see that dangerous pedophiles have such strong supporters  epstein would be proud to hear this  so glad i found this through abe lincolns top hat theyre both so intelligent they

old    this is it chief  this podcast has changed my life  i finally feel comfortable with being sexy because i believe i am  it is ethical educational and thoughtful when delving into topics we arent

without requiring a degree to digest  amanda presents herself as very authentic and extremely enlightening  if youre willing to accept that opportunity to hear another knowledgeable perspective youll

everything you need in a show and of course i bought the book  amanda is my bff in my head lol i really enjoyed your woo episodes especially all the truth spilling  i have loved amandas free spirit and art since the early 2000s  she is a gem to the culture and a truth teller to the world  i love small doses i love a amanda but these last two episodes were awful  they felt so self indulgent  i kept trying to get through them but i feel like im eavesdropping on a private conversation  please dont make small doses something it isnt  i love the shows format  it doesnt need changing i love listening to amanda  shes so funny and funky  her interviews are insightful and give me new perspectives  great show  but whomever is talking way too fast  i changed it several times and restarted the app thinking it was my phone  but it wasnt it was this podcast just talking too fast  i tried listening but i couldnt really grasp anything after a while  amanda all i can say is thank you not for this episode which hits home for me and my truths but for what ive been trying to teach and instill in my 18 yr old coming of age not only in a pandemic but in a social media age that is defining how she sees the world and herself in it your words reinforce mine and show her that im not just being a mom talking but a woman who speaks and lives her truths and there are other women out there who see the world and themselves in it in the same ways so thank you again sis this is the podcast you always knew you needed so insightful honest and funny  amanda is so down to earth  listening to this podcast is like listening to my home girl  love it amanda i just listened to your podcast with sonya renee taylor who is a prophet imo  it was one of the most important and best conversations on the topic of forgiveness and atonement ive ever heard  thank you for sharing it and for all of your many contributions to uplifting and educating us  i really enjoy this podcast  i like amanda and this podcast but the sound effects drive me crazy its too much  i adore this pod its smart af count on amanda to tell it like it is this show is light and funny but still hits on the major issues we are facing in a real way   instant subscribe thank you amanda seales you are the friend that i needed to get through 2020  you often talk about the side effects of being the friend who people come to for advice thats me  and a side effect can be who do i go to for advice well im thankful for you for sparking me with all the gems you give  i hope you have all the love and positive energy that you need to keep keeping on i am certainly sending all that your way  thank you ive been following amanda for a couple of years on instagram and decided to listen to this podcast  im glad i did i love her for the information she brings to the community and the fact she isnt afraid to shed light ocertain off topics its an honor to be able to support you on another platform this episode really opened my eyes in so many ways it really it home for me  thank you happy new year everyone     listening and write my review asap because amanda is too funny and keeps it too real  i listened on and off in 2020 but the recap is making me laugh out loud or nod my head in agreement every other minute  im keeping you in 2021 girl  this is a podcast that fuels her own visions of how people are to be treated but it reveals more about her biased character  she invokes a spirit of disingenuous narrative and a lot of made up reality  to sum it up she talks about herself a lot she needs to try something new  this is not worth listening to even on a boring day  amanda is fiercely intelligent  unwaveringly dedicated to furthering her movement of progressing human society  she possesses a unique vigor and passion that undoubtedly  makes her a riveting educator to the masses   she uses her wit wisdom and humor to elevate minds and progress human society i enjoy listening to this podcast since amanda seales is very encouraging on different subjects every week  so dope and powerful  it is fine i guss it is good but not all that interesting there are not many podcasts that have such an engaging interviewer  i love how amanda challenges her guests in her shows with insightful observations and questions  amandas thoughts and perspective are enriching to my life in that she introduces me into new ways of thinking  thank you for sharing a piece of your world amanda  i recommend everyone to listen when i need to get checked i turn on this dope podcast  lessons with love interesting guests and entertaining sound effects  ive been listening to your show since you promod it on tbc when your special was dropping and i look forward to every topic you present  i love the podcast ive been listening for years but its increasingly become asmry with the constant lip smacking andor eating  i absolutely cannot listen to this with headphones in  it makes my skin crawl not in the positive way so if you hate those lil sounds like me dont listen bc itll take away the content of what shes saying bc youd be distracted by all the sounds her mouth is making  i listen to this podcast for self care   i light my candles  start a bath  and submerged myself in thought  i honestly love amandas perspective  i savory each episode  amanda drops gems love this podcast its so informative thought provoking and funny amanda you are amazing i love your guest hosts as well including the list recent jesse mechanic please keep up with this podcast i have learned so much from this podcast all the

to leave the safety of a traditional job and income and spend all my time on the 40 acres we recently bought woven throughout every podcast is the idea that 80 of your time is spent on some form of marketing no one else elegantly weaves this into the culture like tim does so important thank you kevin o rourke bear bottom acres tim is doing a great job creating an entertaining and information packed podcast his how to s will help redirect you to staying on point and his interviews will inspire you and give you some valuable ah ha moments want to learn how to live a self sufficient

your family top that off that tim is a pleasure to listen to hi tim and liz i really liked the throwback to the farm cast y all are so cute together and your love of life shines through excellent info in the facebook podcast that is relevant information that farmers in today s world really need to know if they want to make it as a business love your podcast all though i listen to it from an android app on my phone i want to join the academy but i feel 25 a month is a bit much i feel if you had a lesser amount or a cheaper yearly fee it would help i understand this is part of your income but as a small farmer trying to get started i feel it is a bit much please keep up the useful information these podcasts are fantastic tim shares a wealth of knowledge and his interviews are always with interesting folks great content and guests professional and engaging delivery helpful and inspiring information and stories high caliber love it i don t listen to podcasts on itunes but i came here just to write a review so i can help bump tim if you re considering a homesteading or self sufficient lifestyle this is very interesting very well produced and very informative thanks tim great podcast interesting information really well produced informative easy to listen to and authentic perspective perfect for anyone interested in modern attainable homestead lifestyle great info as a suburbian i have no interests in moving to a rural area i love the middle ground however as a business woman i find this podcast very interesting and inspiring the show is very good and i love how tim tells it in a story format but honestly i absolutely hate that intro outro it s like nails on a chalkboard tim young s podcast is such an encouragement i have really appreciated hearing other people s stories the podcasts are very encouraging and keep me dreaming of one day making a living for our family while homesteading full time my husband and i along with our 10 children homestead in sc but my husband is self employed in the city with a long commute i hope one day we can figure out how to bring him home thank you so much there are so many homestead prepper simple living podcasts out there some of them are okay but most are you know tim s podcast the self sufficient life is a breath of fresh air it is full of valuable information and is very easy to listen to thank you tim for the time and effort you invest into every episode by the way i really enjoy the episodes when liz joins the conversation her personality is a joy i happened upon this podcast about 1 week ago i listen to every one that i get my hands on i hope to make my jump in 90 to 120 days and listening has helped me close some unforeseen gaps been following tim and liz from the beginning and so grateful for these new season i wait every week for the email and link wohoo typically i m not interested in interview podcasts but this one is assembled in such a way that makes it very listenable i m outside the target market for this podcast but i keep coming back because tim young does such a great job creating interesting stories about his interview subjects i really appreciate how he curates the experience with music and extra information to add context probably my favorite part is how he does 3 take away points at the end of each podcast it reminds me of things i want to remember and consider further i ve learned a lot and will keep listening great podcast good and useful information pleasure to listen too keep up the good work i am a new farmer and have followed tim and liz through out multiple podcasts as i was preparing and gathering information on farming i always appreciate there knowledge of the subject they are dealing with and the humor along the way i have learned a lot from the podcasts and continue to look forward to the most recent one there focus on homesteading has brough some great new info to the table keep up the great work we are listening on the big island of hawaii darrell this is the absolute best homesteading podcast out there right now maybe ever i thoroughly enjoy each episode so informational entertaining and inspirational please keep them coming i really like the positivity of this self sufficiency podcast the stories and lessons are entertaining informational and inspirational i will keep listening to this i always enjoy listening to tim and liz and i appreciate that they share the details of their lives as homesteaders i highly recommend this podcast this is the best podcasts for homesteaders or as far as i m conerned the best and most interesting pocast out today i love it hello y all tim consistently puts together a great podcast i look forward to hearing each week s episode lots of fabulous guest interviews and real life self sufficient information especially from tim his lovely wife tim makes podcasting look sound easy it s not self sufficient life is a podcast you cannot miss in particular i really enjoy listening to him chat with his wife about their homesteading journey she is a delight very inspiring stories from other homesteaders also this podcast pulls instead of pushes people into the positive frame of mind needed get going on the homestead dreams we have lots of great podcasts out there but i often hear a lot of preaching and guilt about wasted time laziness etc not here i think people do sometimes need a push to get going but adult responsibilities are real and become overwhelming we start and stop over and over and get bogged down ending up where we started instead of telling us what to do tim takes stories of people who found better ways to live and relates them to our lives highlighting how we too can stand up start walking and step over the first hurdles to get where we need to be like some other commenters i first thought this was a college class presentation podcast very high quality production great stories excellent production quality my go to podcast for school commutes with the kids they enjoy it too tim has a style that makes you feel like he s in the room talking right to you it s fun to listen and the information and guests are always interesting i always learn something when listening to one of the shows thoroughly enjoyable way to go tim highly inspirational my husband and i left the rat race 6 years ago but had to hobble back to it a year later to afford things the farm needed and then support a baby this podcast inspires me in so many ways and lets me know it s possible even if the 1st time wasn t successful i can t wait to see all the great ideas to try and leave the unsustainable lifestyle behind again this time for good i really enjoy listening to this podcast it helps me get through my friday s at work i really enjoy the content and the delivery these episodes are chock full of value for beginners and folks already living or in the process of transitioning to the country and self sufficient life i have a small homestead now and hope to move to a larger one i have learned a lot already and really enjoy these podcasts nicely done npr style interviews with people who have done what the rest of us want to do keeps me going until i can get there too lots of good info and ideas hands down my favorite new podcast i rank this up there with homegrown liberty and the survival podcast it s suprising that this is new because the production quality is top notch to the degree that you woudl think he s been doing this for a while the content is awesome these stories are so motivating and captivating the music in the background really drives the mood of the story and the narative is very well written it s like listening to an exciting audiobook but better love this podcast and look forward to new episodes every week i ve listened to these multiple times now to get a better grasp on self sufficient design have been following tim and liz since their nature s harmony days have always found their journey to be inspiring the self sufficient life podcasts are excellent wish i had started my journey earlier in life tim is a great podcaster and a wealth of knowledge i hope he always has something going to keep me informed and entertained to be honest my expectations were far exceeded with this podcast as someone who has dabbled in audio recording mixing i can tell you that the author spent a lot of time editing these episodes in my humble opinion it s one of the best podcasts i ve heard in its genre i love how the stories are all intertwined into a larger narrative of self sufficiency and simple living i don t know if i d love farming but the podcast has challenged me to think differently and start moving in a different direction great information about being self sufficient practical too the self sufficient life podcast is a wonderful resource that encourages inspires and motivates me to continue on this journey of homesteading after listening to the first two podcasts i m just so inspired these podcasts are very professionally laid out and they keep you interested i ve got a bit of a following on instagram for my small homestead but now i m thinking i need to step it up and start producing an income during each episode so far the gears are turning in my head thanks to all the wonderful ideas advice and encouragement in each and every minute i ve been a fan of tim young for a while now and even though i m not normally into podcasts i have a feeling this will quickly become part of my weekly routine i really am excited to move onto the next podcast and get caught up it seems each one is better than the last keep up the good work tim we re all forever thankful to you for sharing your knowledge experience and awesome friends with us it s great to hear stories about and advice from people who have successfully made the jump to a more self sufficient life my wife and i are on that journey as well and the financial focus of the podcasts is perfect for us right now as we are both in our second year of home based self employment tim young does a fabulous job talking with some very interesting people about their journey into modern homesteading this has quickly become my favorite podcast i think you will enjoy it too as a small farm with already being homeschoolers and home steaders we are looking forward to having our own business too and creating our own income its very encouraging listening to all of these interviews on how others went through the same process we are going through to get where we want to be hope and lots of tools are what these

narcissists episode  it was great  but left me wondering what can be done from the narcissists perspective if someone were to come to you guys who is a narcissist what can they do to change themselves can they change your advice for someone dating a narcissist is to get out of the relationship  are narcissists always destined to end up alone or in an unhealthy relationshiplove the podcast always very interesting thank you guys so much for all your great work as a person who struggles with anxiety and depression and has spent years in therapy i love this podcast  it covers topics that i have discussed with my therapist  a recent podcast on hyperresponsibility really hit home  i had been discussing it with my therapist so it was very timely to hear the episode  i felt entirely seen as they were describing what causes hyperresponsibility  i highly recommend if you are in therapy or interested in therapy  love your shows  always learn something useful  have you every thought about creating workbooks that go with some of your topics fun and insightful even for the regular folks   can you do some episodes oncomplex traumaattachment theory and trustadoptee trauma and concerns the topics and discussions are fantastic and greatly appreciated  thank you  great informative well presented and so timely  super helpful info and fun to listen to find myself laughing and learning a lot currently in school for a b s in psychology and this podcast inspires me to keep going down this path as a fellow therapist i very much appreciate this podcast as an informative and relatable conversation between two professionals in the field  some days i learn something new and have a take away that i can use with clients  other days i feel encouraged and supported to listen to a conversation in which i think yes thats exactly how i feel about it i thought i was alone i love the presentation as one in which various thoughts opinions and perspectives are fleshed out to offer a variety of insights as opposed to two coworkers coming together to present one modality or way of thinking  the speakers compliment each other very well and present an easy listen  thank you i enjoy listening to this podcast and these therapists because it is straightforward and informative   you will take away a useful tool from each episode and it will help you being older my patience wears thin with the giggly and repetitive babble from many of some podcasts so i enjoy listening to coherent conversation    they present a good balance between personal life professional experience and opinion and conversation  searched high and low for a good podcast channel i started listening a week ago and i feel since then ive become more mindful of what is happening to me and that is it normal  i havent listened to everything but i hear you ask for ideas on what to speak about and i came up with a few 1  why do i have to remind myself that someone is not mad at me i daily or even hourly go through my list of family and friends to try and remember if they are mad at me  when i havent even spoken to them that day and ended on great terms so there will be no reason t feel that way 2  after quarantine how do i deal with the guilt of leaving my pet at home while i go to work or even for parents how do they get their kids back to that routine  3  how can some people spend hours in front of the tv binge watching and some cant sit for 10 minutes for a show  i feel its having to do with avoidance both are trying to distract  if these episodes are already podcasted can you prove the episode numberstay safe and healthy love the show thank you  found this podcast while searching for a specific selfhelp topic  these guys are the best  informative thoughtful funny and no ego  they helped me tremendously in understanding myself and my challenges  easy listen to the point and constructive insights  thanks to you both  highly recommend   free therapy i found this podcast in the midst of an emotional and identity crisis  more than one actually  im on a quest for self reflection self care and this podcast has completely opened my eyes in so many ways  in the last few days of listening ive recommended this podcast multiple times  ive really reconsidered my position and thoughts on therapy self care reflection empathy and my general approach to my life and self accountability  just hearing an outside point of view from an unbiased source about a lot of things im going through    wow this podcast is a game changer for me  keep up this important work  cant wait for future episodes  would you guys ever consider posting your podcasts on a youtube channel i love listening to you guys and a youtube channel would allow more communication with your listeners not sure if you want that lol but it would be great for us thank you for creating this podcast would love to hear your thoughts on vicarious trauma i love these guys their advice is very straightforward and practical  would love an episode on how to accept yourself especially when youve made painful mistakes  this podcast has been immensely helpful  its just a relaxed conversation and its comforting to listen to these guys explain how exactly therapy can help us  nick and todd are thoughtful and detailed  they dont just say a therapist can help you more with this disordered way of thinking theyll explain how they assess a problem and they offer a couple coping mechanisms that could address it  the show is not sensational at all  the episodes arent tethered to some book or celebrity or pr push  they just offer basic workaday help for someone whose habits arent working anymore  if youve ever wondered what exactly happens in therapy nick and todd demystify it  guys thank you so much for making this show  love the first episode totally agree that we psychologists are constantly reading people and trying to make sense of their actionsbehavior   but i would also say that all awarewoke individuals tend to do this behavior  if we are not listening to this information we would not be very effective humans  love the comments   psychologists organize the information about people in an effective way and we have a language that allows us to label and understand behaviors  two smart dudes talking about psychology  nan,41,4.951219512

bloody good effervescent and enlightening definition great investment of time grateful for this podcast these guys are the bomb great stuff ooof yikes infotainment i guess they arent for me insanely good podcast the four agreements episode love these guys smart aussies with personality these guys will stand the test of time engaging youll learn and youll laugh great topics discussed  hard to understand excellent podcast for any book lover no bs love this format two aussie blokes what you will learn  a lot  2 guys that love to read  marvelous  love the show cant listen to it yet    fantastic amazing funny and informative best way to kill time on the drive to work or when on a walk  i used to listen to everyday on my way to school now i listen to it when im eating going to sleep even when taking a dump keep up the good work guys  i could never really get into podcasts until i discovered this one a few months ago  in just a short time ive listened to about 75 of all of the episodes  ive learned so much and really enjoy the synopsis that the guys give of each book  its become a goal of mine to buy and read all of the books that they cover  amazing work guys keep it up pumped to read your new book next year  fantastic banter guys keep it up love the series i love these aussies book recommendations and how they cliff notes it for me with a young family i have no time to read books these days but i am still keen to be intellectually stimulated and these guys are the best i feel like im across all of these amazing insights that i use in my life  theyre also lovely to listen to thank you ive been commuting daily for past 2 5 years i have saved hours of time because these guys pull the important points from the books and do this in an artistic and entertaining way  what i have learned and at times laughed at has allowed me to dig deeper into the books i find interesting  applying what i have learned from this podcast has given me the bright idea to start my own business  i continue to look forward to all the book reviews and interviews  thank you guys wow   what more can i say   this guys are the definition of keeping it real   must be in the aussie dna because you really relate to them as they review the books and apply these lessons to their own life and experiences   keep up the great work   btw the explicit notice this there for a reason love these books but they often say in 200 pages what they couldve said in 25  too much fat  this podcast is a phenomenal alternative  keep it up as with another reviewer i came to the podcast for the atomic habits review  the hateful comments they made in passing about fat people aka whales felt so gross  bummer  started listening to atomic habits was disgusted by shallow cruel tangent about socalled fat whales who dare to be in public eating   not interested in hearing more after such an ignorant thoughtless tirade  im a big fan  great way to review books ive read  and learn stuff from ones i might read  and to learn stuff so i dont have to read the whole book  these guys arewere me 20 years ago  multiple times i have referenced things ive learned in conversation or in practice  give it a try for a book youve already read a while ago or a book youve heard of  i couldnt get past the whale comment in the review if the atomic habits podcast   these just arent my people  i discovered these guys about a week ago and ive been binge listening to their show ever since  everything about this podcast is perfect they pick books that are super interesting and helpful for anyone theyre funny without it getting in the way of having a serious discussion and theyre very good at summing up the books they read and presenting them in digestible and cohesive packages  super glad i found this  and i love their accents as an american i think australian accents are amazing  holy hell my guy please find another water bottle or glass to sip from m  you crushing and sucking on it sounds so oafish and disgusting  the fact that you did that into a microphone is even worse  great book you covered though  these two adams  make my 2 hour round trip commute actually something i now look  forward to   as a nyc elementary school teacher in a very challenging school i need all the help i can get    i am also an athlete health nut  new age wannabe self reflective always looking to improve myself socially  emotionally  financially kind of person   i dont have time to read all the books that i would like to in order to improve myself personally and professionally   what i have learned in this podcast has helped me in all aspects of my life   i consider myself well read and knowledgeable   however i have been exposed to books authors and concepts that have changed my life   ideas and perspectives that have challenged my thinking changed my teaching approach made me a better person all around   do you get my gist in how much i love these guys  cant wait for more    thank you adam and adam for enlightening me making me laugh keeping me company giving me something to look forward to   new knowledge and new books to explore with you  love what im hearing here  i can tell how much the hosts have grown over the progression of the episodes and they do a great job here a great review of self help books often humorous and the back and forth between the two adams keeps the listener engaged  i am so happy i stumbled upon these guys  found them from the easy way to stop smoking review  have been hooked ever since  the best part is the fact that theyre just two good friends who constantly crack jokes and all of this is on top of their amazing book reviews  theyre great st pulling out the golden nuggets of useful knowledge from the best and worst books  being from the us i also love hearing their awesome accents and little language quirks  every time i hear an i love it i smile  and now ill never hear rooted the same way  the episode on the laws of human nature is pure gold  guys i wish youd do longer episodes so we could hear more about your insights on the books i really like a lot of the topics discussed but unfortunately they are often difficult to understand as they both have a veeerrrry strong australian accent  i keep having to rewind parts several times to understand what they said  sometimes the laughing at their own jokes so much gets annoying but overall the podcasts are pretty good and i hope they improve over time  the adam team has an excellent and effective way to convey the essence of the books they review  the recent review of the laws of human nature was outstanding  their interviews with authors add more context to some of the books  i loved the interview with dan ariely  lots of good humor  keep up the excellent work guys truth be told these guys know what theyre talking about  check out their discussion with seth godin but honestly the list of incredible authors featured on this podcast is too long to count  i love podcasts and want to read more books   boom here we go the cohosts are awesome  really digestible content  thank you love the straight forward format of the episodes  no bs ads at the beginning or overlong intros  reading the book itself is one thing but i am capping at 15 pages a day  ive always been a slow reader probably always will be  and this podcasts let me get the jist of a book without feeling like i am a slow reader  the book summary author interview balance is really nice and you can tell these guys are putting in work to make this a great show  its been around for a while so they must really like what they are doing  also i find myself walking away with a cheeky aussie accent thanks for all the work guys love the show  so im not the demographic for these guys  im an almost 50 year old african caribbean woman who can do without some of their crap  however i am a lifelong learner and these podcasts feature amazing books and you learn a ton  plus even if from time to time these guys are full of crap they are authentic and entertaining  basically i am an unlikely fan  thanks guys highly recommended podcast fascinating cerebral  hilarious each episode i learn key things that make my life better  lead me to read books that change lives  listen learn  laugh this show is my main morning private time goto  it has formed a big part of my morning  makes it easy to decide on books i want to go ahead to read  i also love the fun way you review the books  i want to  i love the idea  but the first thing i see in the show description is a typo book should be books this could be a great podcast but that one little thing casts doubt  i cant commit to another podcast with that kind of oversight  not trying trying to sound pretentious  i really want to listen because i think its a great idea for a podcast ill check back in a week to see if its fixed  hope so great podcast  awesome way to recap a finished book with a podcast episode by them  funny and insightful  really really enjoy this podcast  you 2 are hilarious and insightful at the same time very refreshing the songs at the end are killer keep up the great work  definitely recommended from the usa  nan,30,4.4

980133198,What is Wrong with UX,Technology,Laura Klein,980133198,126,213622,entertaining fun way to learn ux laughing in traffic the best medicine 2 stars for not enough wine real wisdom kids pretensiousless ux good for aspiring pms and designers must hear so good great insights poor audio quality perfect blend an intern great laura and kate drop knowledge you laugh a great way to learn ux straight up actionable advice every pod is a happy half hour hanging out with f ing smart people updated review this show gets better and better you ll be enamored with their casual style and straight talk approach i encourage everyone on my team to listen the topics range from beginner to advanced but all are beginner friendly in how they re presented if you re the surprisingly rare type that stays on the bleeding edge in design ux or product you ll find many concepts you re already familiar with do not let that deter you from subscribing it s surprisingly helpful to hear these concepts applied in different areas the war stories about them in practice and even just having them reinforced by people who you d happily join in a wine whine sesh the show leans more towards theory than practice which honestly is better for a podcast though i would like to hear more specifics fingers crossed these two expand the brand to include content and workshops that focus on the nitty gritty of implementation like an online paint nite but with state tables instead of canvases and drunk ux people instead of drunk ex sorority girls omg laura and kate are so funny i just learned about this podcast i m only up to episode 3 so far but was already laughing since episode 1 this is such an awesome podcast to listen to while i m doing work looking forward to more thanks for making me laugh loved the everyone is a designer episode i was super frustrated and a tad confused by this phenomenon as well looking forward to more episodes you guys are hilarious i had to pour my own glass as a workaround plus 7 stars for snark and making me grin and laugh out loud on a near constant basis love this it s just fun listen up millenials these women were this wise before you were born pay close attention to them cheers kate laura is the best ux podcast fun insightful informative it s last week tonight full frontal rachel maddow real time where the world of ux is the subject rather than politics so it leaves the audience slightly less depressed i love it unfortunately the two podcasts i listened to were full of patently obvious insights and some bad advice as a product manager i would strongly discourage other pms from wasting their time here great though if you re unfamiliar with product management and design and are looking for a primer this is my new favorite thing if you are in the field of ux and or design and or touch digital products in any capacity this podcast is a moral imperative and it s the most raw and funniest take on the industry that is available anywhere i love this podcast there aren t many ux podcasts out there and i was so happy to find this one they give real honest advice about ux and it s useful for everyone from beginners to much further in your career it is like having two really great ux mentors that have already covered everything you might want to ask them in a recorded format and of course they re funny and entertaining too i leave this review out of love because laura and kate do such a great job at taking their wealth of design and product insights and presenting it in a fun approachable way unfortunately the audio isn t very good i ve been listening for a while and they still haven t made any improvement in recording quality that nearly all of the other small podcasts i listen to have done to ensure a great experience for listeners this podcast covers a lot of important topics for design professionals and i d recommend it to anyone with the audio issues resolved just found this podcast after attending a conference laura spoke at the hosts are hilarious have a great rapport and are obviously very experienced each episode is a perfect blend of information advice and laughs this podcast is an insightful look into the industry even if you re not going into ux it s completely relevant to really anyone who is in the making things kind of industry i m someone who s about to graduate college who s looking to become a product designer they re episode on product designers was amazing btw and all this material is completely accessible to me so you ll have no problem understanding what points they re trying to make i can only hope to find a mentor like them someday it s great it s the best buy it kate and laura share their deep knowledge of ux with funny stories that are sometimes actually true don t let the fun tone fool you there are great insights that can make you work smarter this podcast is the most interesting way to learn really useful insights in ux a must listen for any practicing and aspiring designer less swearing than i expected and way more useful actionable advice any modern designer woudl do well to listen to these two leading lean startup figures as they teach you how to make products that have a shot of making it in the market 2 opinionated ladies drinking wine what could go wrong nothing great thoughts from 2 leaders in the field at it s very best this podcast will make you better at your job for example the c fwot episode isn t just about complaining about or even avoiding wastes of time it s breathing new life into the hollow expression fail fast the rest of the time it s two funny real people with solid conversational rapport being smart about ux and design some of this is a little inside baseball but it s never boring nan,18,4.722222222

perfect 20something fun love yes love all the episodes so very much  as a young aspiring wellness god in the midwest the conversations you guys have are informative and interesting i came from kates instagram and she is the reason i read my favorite book women who run with the wolves would recommend this podcast to any intelligent young person with taste as a fellow vegan midwestern gal who was a victim of the hclf youtube community i relate to so much of this podcast  as much as i love it though i dont always feel like it makes wellness feel more accessible  sometimes after listening im left left feeling like i am missing out on certain wellness products that are super expensive  i think its still a fun podcast and the meme page is pure gold but i dont think it makes wellness feel any less exclusionary or capitalistic  not only is this podcast funny but it brings up ideas from wellnesspolitics that are not really talked about enough within the wellness community  love it this podcast has become a weekly staple of my silly little morning routine  i love kate and emmas relatability especially when my spiraling seems to be in synch with theirs which makes me feel slightly less insane  the controlled chaos and hilarity that ensues throughout each episode particularly the intros and outros makes the daunting world of wellness digestible pun intended and attainable

workinprogress wellness god myself i find myself relating so much to this podcast  love listening to them at during my days at work  the food  climate change episodes were my favorite thus far just

ladies this is my favorite games and entertainment program cutting the right blend between entertainment news reviews and commentary  glad you guys kinda explained all the nuances of the fck up and separated that from the gameplaystory  i was not aware of the certification process with console makers actually found female vs voice acting ok  male v however is awful and i dont understand why panams romance is locked to male v but whatever lol    just kidding  ive been listening almost a year at this point  as a lady trying to get into the gaming industry its nice to have a podcast that covers all the topics im interested in and doesnt get caught up talking about the lack of animated butt in the middle of my zombie killing adventures  i love the mix of news opinions and husbandos  keep it up or maybe dont theres still plenty of episodes im still catching up on good theme good show good topics great ladies stay awhile and listen  i recently started a new job where im allowed to listen to podcast during my shift  whats good games was suggested to me by a friend and im so thankful for that suggestion  andrea brittney and steimer are witty and intelligent and share my favorite love video games found these folks from funhaus  just as funnyjust as informed and really good at giving the industry news without being boring  recommend to everyone who follows games  fantastic pod

shift fly by  love listening to them on the way home from work on the way to work and while im at work  they always keep me updated on all gaming news  thank you so much for the content hi tihs is a good pidcast but my fone is wet so i cant chanje the reveiw to 5 str sirry wgg is a welcome oasis in the rather broheavy environs of the video game press  the ladies know the industry inside and out and theres a contagious joy in their conversations  noice i just recently started listening to this show to help fill my long and boring work shifts  i love the generally fun and silly attitudes of the cast while still giving me a fairly indepth news summary on video games  it really keeps me in an upbeat mood during those before mentioned work hours  there really isnt any other show like this around i love it so much  hands down one of my favorite gaming podcasts and i listen to a lot arguably too many but let a man live  the dynamic between the ladies is fantastic and feels like youre in a conversation with real friends and their insight and opinions are respectable and relatable  heres hoping 2021 continues to be a great year for the whats good gals and i cant wait for more amazing contentalso the introoutro music is an absolute bopfest  awesome podcast going over current video game news  and as a female gamer myself i love this podcast so much highly recommend  i look forward to listening all week   its nice to have a podcast with a positive attitude where the hosts dont take themselves too seriously   i was going to give it a 4 5 but andrea pronounced my name correctly which is the first time in the last decade someones gotten it first try  huge thanks and props to these wonderful ladies for bringing me my weekly gaming fix andrea brit and steimer bring insights and analysis to the weeks news from inside the industry  theyre also not afraid to combat the toxic pitchfork tar and feathers attitude of a lot of the gaming community not only that they talk about what theyve been playing new and old and have made me pick up games i never would have considered otherwise thanks for bringing a voice and viewpoint of someone similar to me into the front of games media i turned the sled to 0 5x last week on this podcast and it was hilarious but other than that these girls are hysterical at normal speed also 1010 would recommend for anyone interested in video games i dont listen to a lot of podcasts but you know what ive listened to pretty much every episode of wgg with my spouse  if you are looking for a unique perspective on games and you enjoy realtime fact checking look no further its refreshing to find a game podcast that focuses on the facts dives into inclusion and occasionally random things like seal husbandos  ladies thanks for doing what you do and providing us joy in these crazy times     im really here for that intro theme slap some firefor real real tho play prince of persia  since the pandemic ive been working remotely   in order to keep my sanity i decided to subscribe to some gaming podcasts  wgg was the first podcast i listened to and its by far my favorite  you guys have wonderful chemistry a positive outlook and are proud of your obsessions britt and steimer have me addicted to yakuza  thank you for making this difficult time in our world a bit more tolerable  i love you   when i first discovered whats good games i was just looking for a podcast that would help keep up to date and engage with the gaming community preferably from a female perspective  however when the pandemic hit and i found myself working from home my podcast listening dropped off almost entirely leaving me missing many of the shows i loved  whats good games was the only podcast that i maintained throughout the year  each weeks episode and for a while two episodes with the monday live show provided me with all the thoughtful analysis i could want  but more importantly if offered plenty of funny stuff and the delight of listening to folks who love what they do  the humor and sense of play in each episode honestly helped me through the hellscape of 2020 providing me with something to look forward to each week  thanks ladies  keep up the good work  i am a stay at home parent during the pandemic and i frequently watch the show on youtube but also on itunes  the segments are always fun the guests are delightful and the sheer energy from these ladies is nothing short of charming  whats good games is an informative and entertaining podcast hosted by some of the most knowledgeable funny and charming ladies in gaming  each new episode is a highlight of my week  great podcast keep up the good work thanks 5 star review do good  this pod cast is great but he amount of add time and this almost feels like is a clickbait yt video too much

                                           i recently started fulltime work as a delivery driver so ive discovered a bunch of new podcasts to pass the time  whats good games is the best one ive found and its been a blast burning through the backlog  im back to september now and its kinda fun reliving the nextgen hype  i love the chemistry between the hosts and the unique insights they can each bring to a topic ps if anyone hasnt listened to the game awards episode yet do it the categories are so fun  is there a better podcast out there probably but this is the one you should listen to anyway i stumbled on this podcast over the summer after looking for a way to escape into the world of video games  as a father of two young kids my time to play games has taken a hit  even though i may never get a chance to play their analysis and discussion of these games is a great way to experience them  i highly recommend them to anyone seeking a great balance of video game news commentary and offtopic shenanigans  thank you for all the hours of news and entertainment  keep up the great work hello ladies i just wanna say that i love your podcast  i found it in mid march while searching for witcher 3 content once i started listening i couldnt stop  all of yall are so charming and work so well together  its so refreshing to find a gaming podcast run by women  ive now listened to most of your backlog and look forward to when new episodes come out  i recently was listening to an episode late one night where yall were talking about the resident evil two remake which reminded me that i never finished playing it so i decided to hop back in and play i was right at the lab and about to go into nest i learned that playing scary games at 100am while no one else is awake is a bad idea  keep up the amazing podcast with amazing people and have a wonderful day i like the way they can get you twisted in to there opinions and thoughts about a game while letting me know if it would be a good game choice or not while letting me know about game news thank you for doing this god bless i really enjoy this podcast and their ability to focus on what a game is versus what it isnt  sometimes other gaming podcasts can be frustrating bc of a constant comparison between a new game and a favorite game so that it becomes a list of all the ways the new game falls short  these ladies do a really great job of exploring a specific game as its own entity and even when it may not be good or has some problems by super critical standards i like that they point out that it is still fun and enjoyable  also the last of us part ii spoilercast is one of my top episodes of the year of any gaming podcastit was so reflective and interesting  great content on the most recent news reviews of the newest games and what to avoid in the gaming world  the world of gaming can be like a complex level but like a game guide these girls guide you through  plus who doesnt love gamer girls i listen nearly every week  which is interesting because i dont even like most of the games that are normally discussed   i simply enjoy hearing you ladies have conversations about the industry that i love and the good vibes that you put out  so thank you for being part of my car rides for the past few years  p s  steimer 4ever i just realized today that i have been listening to this show for nearly 3 years the first episode i ever listened to was your december 2017 game award predictions episode when i was convinced horizon zero dawn would win goty oh the disappointment i still feel  i downloaded that and the rest of the january lineup to get me through my 8 hour drive back from visiting family for the holidays and have been hooked ever since  listening to you ladies talk about games gaming news and seal husbandos has brought me so much happiness and this message is long overdue  if anyone out there loves video games and wants an hour or two of smiles and laughs per week from one of the the most knowledgeable and articulate crews out there this is the podcast for you  thank you wgg more woman led games media i love this podcast and even if ive heard the stories covered on other outlets because i just love hearing what these women have to add to convo  super funny super witty and all around a solid source for game stuff if you dont feel like scraping the depths of the internet  keep it up best gaming podcast hands down and i love the different perspective these women bring to the conversation  also cant miss friday shows where we get to bask in the beauty of kristine steimer keep up the great work gals  recently discovered whats good games and i highly recommend this podcast  the hosts are very passionate about video games and the industry and deliver great info and opinions while also being hilarious  has easily become my favorite whether viewing whats good games on other platforms the podcasts are equally enjoyable to watch on youtube or twitch and the quality remains the same with the audio version  never a dull moment between the trinity  is there a dance studio nearby these wonderful women never miss a beat keep up the great work you three my ears and i thank you and being an english major soon to graduate you would think this was my term paper but the repeated listens to various episodes says it all   thank you again and i look forward to future podcast episodes  nan,50,4.82

1524540025,What's Missing,Documentary,Casefile Presents,1524540025,10,48744,all excellent too much of a good thing powerful moving all too real amazing i tried to choke thru this but can t too sad and too long hate the clips i want to like this excellent r u afraid i just can t tell maybe you re a 5 paul wright got bored i m so sorry heartbreakingly human support group for families of missing loved ones good in concept so so in execution impactful in ways i did not expect thank you for this podcast with a purpose looking forward to listening to this i was interested in listening to this new series however like several others the the host speaks a little to fast to get all of the information at times this is an excellent important heartbreaking podcast it s kind of insulting to think that people don t feel for families of those who are missing how many of these grief sessions must we share to be considered caring enough as part of a program that discusses the disappearance of someone this is fine but an hour devoted strictly to this kind of sharing what is to be gained the only lesson from the story of bung is to not sadly allow children to walk to school this is one of the more amazing podcasts i ve ever heard it gets add the real experiences of people who are trying to find someone they love who is missing but who gets caught in between the conversations are insightful and candid i find it very moving and appreciate the vulnerability of all who participated loren is extremely talented and my celebrity crush so this i absolutely love it she does a great job and very unique perspective while shedding light on this horrible thing support the cause i came here from casefile which i love this podcast is agony aunt relatives repeating for over an hour about their losses repeat repeat no real info on what really happened this is more like therapy for people who have lost loved ones who were never found i respect what you are doing but it s not being targeted to the right audience good luck i like the mission behind this podcast and because i am a huge fan of casefile i gave it a try i found it to be a very depressing way to spend my free time even though i feel so much for these families also it s simply too long needs some good editing for families who have had someone go missing perhaps this podcast could provide some support just not for me i can t take the pre recorded clips just tell the story in your own voice i was really looking forward to this podcast but honestly it s just way too long for me the information and care that has been given to each episode is amazing but i feel that information is repeated multiple times i do not think these need to be over an hour in length i love this podcast so thoughtful and eye opening i admire the strength of the families and feels me with so much hope the narrator is caring and empathetic i am hooked do you really have knowledge about scientology or are you truly afraid to share your experiences i can t tell so far your we re a couple of good ole boys see slap me on m back act is confusing the processing my heart genuinely broke while listening to nick and jenny speak about their son paul wright he sounds like a wonderful soul just as they do i cannot fathom the pain of missing a child sending much love and blessings their way i love the beginnings of all the episodes but when the q a starts i get bored fast would rather hear more about the stories like ic coldcase life hurts when you lose your loves not knowing where a loved one is has to be the scariest thing you can experience i will send love and prayers for you that you find out about your son bless both your sons i was a bit skeptical about listening to this podcast because of the ambiguity of the subject matter missing persons who haven t been found but what i got was a deeply felt listening experience about empathy and compassion for those who are suffering from ambiguous loss the host of the show sets the right empathetic tone with each person she interviews leaving the listener feeling compassion for those left behind very well done can t really review 2 episodes but so far i am concerned that there will be too much reiteration of content regarding the common problems that exist for all of the families of missing loved ones this podcast will end up telling the same story over and over again ie the good and bad of social media the inherent problems that families face when trying to wrap up the accounts estate and insurance issues of an adult that is missing but not declared dead family members that are advocating for the missing have to reiterate the missing loved one s story over and over again this podcast s intended audience seems like it would be geared to the actual families of missing loved ones similar to a support group it demonstrates that one is not alone in the context of having a missing loved one going forward i hope the podcast content becomes more exceptionally unique in each episode if we learn about problem x in episode 1 put it away and do not reiterate problem x in subsequent episodes i just worry that each episode will be telling the same story but using a different voice i want this podcast to be a success personally i hope it evolves into each episode spending 90 of the episode covering the events leading up to the disappearance and then cover the events post disappearance up leading up to it becoming a cold case or when police lose interest the last 10 should be how the family is handling life without their loved one and what could be asked of the public again many of these families face common problems some of them are really personal i hope the focus of the episode shifts to 90 of the case and 10 of how the family is contending with the same or very similar problems that the other families are facing this podcast is a good idea to raise awareness and generate empathy however i was board to tears listening to question after question about the person s feelings followed by the same sad responses this q a could be done in a quarter of the time for people to step into the victim s shoes to improve the podcast each experience could be framed as a story narrative of the victim s experiences maybe followed by some personal questions the personal but engaging small plot of how the loved one went missing would engage the listener and then a short heartfelt q a would nicely wrap it up this podcast has a lot of potential but it s structure should be changed to keep people engaged and subscribed i have to admit i was totally sucked into this podcast i pulled it up to give it a try and was so hooked it s like my world disappeared for an hour love that the narrator is excellent she has empathy not just sympathy but skips needless drama she pulled me in to the point i felt i knew this family though they are halfway around the world from me i wanted to fly to australia and help jason s family look for his dad well done i m here due to casefiles which is part of this channel s family i believe i enjoy cold case missing person podcasts but find it hard to find good content casefile along with somebody knows something are my favorite pods for cold case i am so excited to find a good missing person pod finally a podcast that discusses missing people in a non exploitive way loren is a host who understands first hand what her guests are going through and her conversations are compassionate and focus proper attention on the subjects great podcast i am excited to see what the future holds i have a very good feeling that this podcast is going to be really good i m looking forward to listening to this nan,21,3.714285714

1279384082,What's The Frequency?,Drama,James Oliva,1279384082,26,30379,im confused not bad warped and wonderful madness midsentence commercial breaks do yourself a favor and listen to this weird and i love it couldnt make it through an episode delightfully bizarre for sound nerds creepy brilliance one of my favorite shows neat excellent too lynchian exceptional cdole weird and awesome i have no idea what the hell is going on but i am ready for anything i love this podcast but a strange kind of wonderland strange gorgeous and terrifying very cool hooked from the first episode the cronenburg touched audio drama super fun advanced audio drama listening so good amazing sound design top notch sound design cant wait for more nancypants sounds great amazing and unique so weird i cant wait to see where it goes im really not smart enough for this show  its an interesting concept and i like mischief and co but i listen to podcasts while i do other things and i cant do that with this bad boy a bit too impressed with itself  the david lynch of audio dramas but with a touch more style and narrative drive  i am enthralled  cannot wait for season two i have no idea whats going on i cant honestly tell if theres a story going on here but i also cant stop listening  its like an audio rubix cube its frustrating but i also dont think i can stop until its finished  good job lol might be good but ill never know with jay farmer of quicken loans barging in midsentence  after the third ad in the trailer and then another commercial break after a minute of the first episode i gave up  this show is absolutely brilliant  there are so many things i love about it theres not enough room to list them all here  all of the characters are so much fun and are so interesting  the story takes so many turns and imo the bestscariest thing about it is how it constantly breaks barriers and expectations in such unexpected ways  pls do yourself the favor of listening to this phenomenal show  this show is doing some fabulous experimental stuff with narrative audio  this is a psychedelic adventure and a wild ride  definitely a good one for close listening  love it  multiple commercial interuptions in a 3 minute trailer should have given me pause  too many interuptions to the flow  maybe i would enjoy it but not with this story flow  this show is great and includes crisp impeccable audio design dimercurio spelling brings an air of desperate pressure to everything shes in  very enjoyable for the setting lovely cant wait for more  fantastic actors and top notch sound design  the show has an amazingly creepy vibe  however this show is about 60  sound design and 40 plot  while it was interesting for the first few episodes by the finale i was very ready for a resolution and more dialogue  i just finished listening to the first season and my mind is rattled my teeth clenched and my nerves unglued  but in a good way what the frequency is a crazy avantgarde disturbing yet humorous roller coaster of a mystery  detectives are investigating a missing writer and people are being adversely influenced by the only radio show left on the air  and we all want to know    what is the frequency highly recommended but not for the faint of heart  the writing and sound design are simply superb  do yourself a favor and check this show out i have no idea whats going on but its a fun ride im willing to take magnificent storytelling incredible execution  definitely not for everyone  for fans of the deep vault  archive 81 but who wanted it to be more david lynch and less coherent storytelling  if you loved the twin peaks revival this is definitely for you  i found it to be mediocre and disjointed at the start and it only got worse as it went on  i really like the podcast very interesting drama pod  however the prolonged static is tearing my ears apart   cant wait for more  this show is freaking great  the use of sound to create such a rich layered universe is nearly unrivaled and the performances are on point  the dry cleaner scene in episode 3 is flatout terrifying  highly recommended  this podcast can be hard to follow sometimes but that just makes it more interesting  i recommend listening to it a couple of times so you really get everything that is going on  but it is worth it youre stuck in a giant solid cube of jello  around you in the jello are 10000 bats  the bats are staring at you  you hear very distantly a numbers station  it is just barely quiet enough you cant tell what the numbers are but you know something is happening  the bats are staring at you  their eyes are wide and they are whispering  you shiver  the jello quivers  the numbers station fades in and out of clarity until you can a l m o s t hear the numbers but then it is quiet again hushed by the jello  the bats blink  you shiver  the jello quivers  but i do sometimes get a little frustrated with how long certain moments can drag out  in a 30 min episode for example i might expect to lose 10 min to introoutros  ads  that would still leave 20 min of new story and plot line to enjoy  in this podcast i often feel like im losing at least half of that remaining time to awkward silences and things like characters repeating the same lines with different inflections  which is great for creating a certain atmosphere and works well for this podcast but it does get a little frustrating when were four episodes in and weve gotten more concrete information from the podcasts summary than from the episodes themselves  whats the frequencyis not lying when they describe themselves as psychdelic   a freeform kind of noir tale with some of the best sound design i have ever heard and thats not even mentioning the superb calibre of voice acting   eerie is the word i would use and at some points terrifying like the sound of nails on a chalkboard when you cant see anything  whats the frequency is one of my absolute favorite audio dramas even with its few episodes released so far  i love that this show doesnt feel a need to set the scene using dialogue everything is conveyed perfectly through its gorgeous production  the show is both terrifying and hilarious  the writing is quick and sharp and the characters are delightful  this podcast should absolutely not be slept on its one of the most innovative pieces of audio drama ive ever heard  this is an unusal show  its surprising charming and delightfully odd  great acting  man these are some voices what starts off as a random radio static drama it begins to twist and turn into a world that im terrified yet enthralled with  i am terrified every time i listen to this show  not scared like walking down a dark hallway  terrified like watching the thing for the first time when youre 8 years old  unlike anything ive ever heard and im intrigued  cant wait to hear more i wanted to wait until the second episode came out to leave a review though ive been along for this ride since before episode one im an all day sucker for noir and mystery  and the characters are so much fun walter and whitneys dynamic is amazing  the complementary contrary pairim most curious about how the different mysteries we have

compare or come close to what olivia has accomplished with whats the juice  i just finished season 1 listening start to finish this last month and cant even describe the range of amazingness in each episode  olivias incredible candor paired with her special guests filled me up in every way during literally every episode  the amount of knowledge packed into each minute was mind blowing and the cohesiveness from episode to episode made listening to this podcast super enjoyable coming from someone who thought they hated podcasts  cannot wait for season 2 every time i listen to olivias podcast im writing tons and tons of notes i learn so much from her and her guests  it has lead me to explore more into herbalism astrology and traditional chinese medicine  i love it so much  thank you a million times over for sharing your story about yours and your parents fight against coronavirus  they are so lucky to have a daughter like you  i listened to it while my mom was in the hospital battling covid and we were right in the thick of it when i came across your story  it was my first time listening to your show but now i will be a fan forever  because of you i learned how to advocate for my mother in a way that i never wouldve had the guts to do prior to your hearing your story  that i didnt have to feel bad for harassing the nurses i learned that it didnt matter if they hated me because i was fighting for my mothers life  i learned that i could do more than just sit around and wait for bad news  your story empowered me to do things i never wouldve done before and i truly believe it saved my mothers life  saying thank you cannot express even a fraction of my gratitude  there are no words  as far as im concerned you changed my life and in turn saved my mothers life  thats something to be proud of  olivia is so knowledgeable and makes information super easy to comprehend  i love how she keeps it real and dives right into the topic at hand  her episodes on digestion and the infradian rhythm have truly been so monumental in my self care journey  i recommend this podcast to anyone and everyone i highly recommend this podcast  i learn so much and am inspired after each episode  sending lots of love and gratitude   i am loving this podcast olivia packs every episode with tons of amazing content guests and interviews that will motivate uplift and inspire you  i highly recommend love her podcast but do not order products because she does not respond for customer service  my package arrived with broken bottles and she will not acknowledge this to replace my expensive items  please olivia i thought you were awesome make this right  everything about this podcast is pure gold  in no particular order heres what i like the most about it  olivias perceptive interview style  every single guest  olivia is living in alignment with their purpose  the intro song it perfectly represents the essence of the show  plus its unbelievably catchy the passion    its truly refreshing love you oo team xx signing in  virgo sun gemini moon cancer rising  this is one of my fav podcasts youre so passionate and the information always hits my soul so much and i look forward to each episode   however one tip id like to leave is be mindful of the microphone  in episode 14 when tasting the herb you make smacking noises and in past episodes when agreeing with your guests you almost moan into the mic  its kind of off putting when trying to take in information and very distracting when trying to listen to your guests  again i love everything youre doing i just thought id send out that little tip  i am writing a review because over the course of a week i have binge listened to about five of olivias podcast episodes  and they have completely changed my life  i have sent these episodes to my friends and family and im probably going to be really listening to most of them  this podcast is the perfect blend of health grounded in science mixed with alternative medicine and sprinkled with magic  every person she has brought on has been so insightful and truly helpful in giving you tools to change your life  i also love how real and personal she gets with all her intros and her relationship with her partner nick  my favorite podcast by far  im gonna sign inhi virgo capricorn virgo speaking im slowly coming out of the great depression chapter of my life lol and i found your ig only 3 weeks ago and i unexpectedly binged so hard on your podcast  ive listened to over 30 hours so far and im actually really sad to be nearing the last few episodes of the season  i can be a skeptic when it comes to the woowoo stuff but nick is rightyoure a fantastic interviewer olivia  these episodes have completely monopolized my podcast feed  i feel like your genuine alignment with your intuition drives such interesting rounds of questioning  your deep curiosity and researchbased approach to every subject spurs my curiosity  it has allowed me to open up and study every facet of my own life and just what i needed right now besides therapy im americanborn chinese so tcm and herbology resonates deeply with me but the spiritual aspects of this podcast has really touched me especially generational healing hello child of immigrant issues i was going to write this as an extremely long email but thought it would better serve its purpose here  i know you have a huge following and repeatedly mentioned throughout your episodes was your fear of getting in trouble and holding your voice back because of your large audience within a polarizing world  i feel that so big and just wanna tell you to keep doing whatever youre doing because its inspiring me to get my intuition in check and flow with it the way you do  you do you  so much love to the oo team  i am a forever fan   i found olivia on instagram during covid  her knowledge about herbs and natural remedies really lit a fire inside me  once i found her podcast i was just drawn in  i find this information very interesting  ive always been more drawn to natural remedies  so this is totally up my alley i hope to take this information and help better my health naturally  this podcast has restored hope in me about my health that has never received proper diagnosis or healing i have an autoimmune disease that has not been properly identified and so many health issues that olivia discusses throughout her podcast  up until i found this podcast i felt like i just had to live in pain and there was no cure but i have hope again knowing that i am by far not the only one experiencing what i do i am so thankful i have been able to better serve my body and my health from what ive learned from olivia and overall more clarity thank you  i will always be grateful for finding olivia on instagram years ago  ive learned so much her podcasts are definitely worth the listen ive been on a health quest for over five years consuming what functional medicine information i can  the blend that olivia provides with her guests and her personal insight has made it into my essentials playlist  her holistic approach provides a voice of reason care and hope for anyone  healthy or on their quest to cure  plus her spiritual zingers and horoscope birth charts give me the giggles  highly recommend anyone to listen this is a material that goes beyond what any solid athome researchers can discover easily  im a selftaught herbalist  severe health junkie  ive studied and read up on modern health for years   and like many of you that can relate we often are ahead of the mainstream game before things catch on  what is discussed in this podcast is truly cutting edge  i think this is my favorite podcast out right now that mixes spirituality and modern health  thank goodness we have someone focusing on femme bodies and the general public  to be completely transparent i wasnt sure about the podcast in the beginning because the intro triggered my growingup in california valley girl hesitance and for some reason the juice metaphors and drippy sounds    startled me nonetheless as a sensual performance artist i appreciate the sensuality and the honesty that is so deeply rooted in this podcast  never judge a podcast by its cover intro thank you so much olivia 3 thank you olivia thank you olivia for bringing this important knowledge and perspective to the mainstream  this podcast is saving us from generational trauma from patterns lifestyles and mindsets that dont serve us from divisiveness that hold us back and from disease including covid19 i truly believe that people like olivia amitrano and her team are saving the world  whats the juice has blown me away with all of the valuable information and insight on such interesting and intriguing topics  olivia brilliantly covers everything from managing stress to healing trauma and balancing hormones and the gut microbiome perfectly while sprinkling in her knowledge of herbalism and using plants to truly heal the mind and body  bravo olivia for using your talent and intelligence to spread your message of health wellness and happiness to your pod fam shout out to your boyfriend nick and your whole crew for taking the time to put all of this goodness together each week i appreciate your hard work and dedication i cant wait to see whats in store for season 2  olivia has a way of making you
